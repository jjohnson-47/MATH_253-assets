00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,770
Hi class.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,430
>> Let's take a look at

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,590
double integration
and volume.

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,260
This is an overview
of Section 13.2.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,835
We can define double
integrals with

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,530
Riemann sums in
a similar way

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,165
we do in calculus too,

8
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,830
where we sub-divide

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,300
the region of integration,

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,460
which we're going
to refer to as our.

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,965
In here we have this
circular region.

12
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,320
And you can see
we can estimate

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,779
the region with tiny
little rectangles.

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,990
And within each
rectangle we can find

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,310
the volume underneath

16
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,450
the surface of a function.

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,320
So in each rectangle we

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,150
have a width and a height,

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,820
and then the
width and length,

20
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,280
and then the height is
the functions value at

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,970
some point inside
the rectangle.

22
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,180
Now, usually in a
calculus class,

23
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,950
we take just any point

24
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,910
within that rectangle

25
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,350
to determine the height.

26
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,000
We can do in more
sophisticated

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
ways where maybe we take

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,430
the height to be

29
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,180
the maximum of

30
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,290
the function within
the rectangle.

31
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,980
But we don't really

32
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,405
need to worry
about that much.

33
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:03,770
But any ways for each

34
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,730
of these little rectangles,

35
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,635
we can estimate
the volume there.

36
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,360
And the idea is to find

37
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,400
these slivers of volumes

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,240
and then add them all

39
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,470
up to estimate
the integral.

40
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,290
So we can define the double

41
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,570
integral over a region as

42
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,685
the sum of all of these
sliver volume pieces,

43
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,670
as this part here,

44
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,250
which is the
magnitude of delta a,

45
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,095
gets close to 0.

46
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,660
And that's just a way

47
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,390
to keep track of how
big the rectangles are.

48
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,300
And INR book, we're
defining delta a

49
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,860
as the sort of
maximum length

50
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,090
of all the rectangles,

51
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,960
maximum length of

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,310
the diagonals
above rectangle.

53
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,870
So that small, then

54
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,550
all of the rectangles
are small.

55
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,740
And we're just
taking the sum of

56
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,990
these smaller and smaller
and smaller pieces.

57
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,520
And the limit of that is

58
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,275
what we're calling
the double integral.

59
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,990
And it's intuition is

60
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,790
that the volume underneath
the surface over

61
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,720
the region for beneath

62
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,770
them allows us to write

63
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,710
these double integrals
as iterated integrals,

64
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,405
so that we can
actually compute them,

65
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,685
but only for
certain regions.

66
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,185
So regions that are

67
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,540
bounded between
two constants with

68
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,430
respect to one
variable and then

69
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,660
between two functions

70
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,680
with respect to the other.

71
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,885
Let's take a look
at an example.

72
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,010
So here we have a function

73
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,795
x, y plus e to the y.

74
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:32,375
And we want to
find the volume,

75
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,370
and we're saying signed
volume because if

76
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,175
the graph where to go
below the xy axis,

77
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,735
z values will be negative

78
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,135
and its volume there
would count as negative.

79
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:42,320
We're trying to find

80
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,795
that volume under
the surface,

81
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,310
over the region
R, which is,

82
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,095
happens to be a rectangle.

83
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:49,850
In this case, the limits of

84
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,325
integration are quite
easy to deal with.

85
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,950
We have x is going between

86
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,565
34 and y values
going between 12.

87
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:02,090
So we can write this
integral either as a DX,

88
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,290
DY integral where we hold y

89
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,330
constant between
12 and then

90
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,710
integrate with respect to

91
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,480
X from three to four,

92
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,390
or vice versa, where
we hold x constant

93
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,950
between 34 and
then integrate

94
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,570
Y from one to two.

95
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,250
And either way,
if we compute

96
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,570
these inter
iterated integrals

97
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,500
will get the same value.

98
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,550
The properties of
double integrals

99
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,125
are very familiar.

100
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,435
Thankfully, they're
pretty much the same as

101
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,600
integrals over a
region in calculus,

102
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,685
to a one-dimensional
region,

103
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,245
we can pull constants out,

104
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:38,300
add, and subtract them.

105
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,835
If the function
is positive,

106
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:43,325
then the integral
should be positive.

107
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,365
If you have two functions,

108
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,730
one is always greater than

109
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,960
the other that
moves like the

110
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,310
integral of the
larger one to be

111
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,095
greater than the integral
of the smaller one.

112
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,940
And number five is the part

113
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,730
that might not seem that
important at first,

114
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,140
but incredibly important,

115
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,580
which says that
if we're trying

116
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,950
to find the
volume underneath

117
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,165
the surface of a function

118
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,680
over a particular region.

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,240
And maybe it's that reasons

120
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,505
complicated or has
a couple parts.

121
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:09,620
And it's difficult to write

122
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,480
a singular
iterated integral,

123
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,249
integral that will do that.

124
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,290
>> We can cut our into

125
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,510
pieces that are
non-overlapping,

126
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,070
in whose union
is the whole,

127
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,659
the whole space R.

128
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,325
>> And then we
can just find

129
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:25,500
those individual integrals
and add them up.

130
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,555
So here's a double integral

131
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:31,790
of the function
form minus y.

132
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,014
And we're trying
to find the volume

133
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:39,259
of this between the
two parabolas here.

134
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,940
>> So the first thing
we always do is sketch

135
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,890
the region of
integration just to

136
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,270
get a visual of where

137
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,955
we are finding integral.

138
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:49,624
And here we have
our two functions.

139
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:53,030
>> And we have the
choice to evaluate the

140
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,480
integral as an iterated
integral with dx,

141
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,805
dy, or dy dx.

142
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,710
Whatever happens to be

143
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,960
easier is usually
the best choice.

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,345
Here I'm choosing
to do dy, dx, dy y.

145
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:14,435
Because if we add

146
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:18,605
up for any fixed
y from 0 to four,

147
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:21,110
we can integrate from x

148
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,360
is going from
left to right.

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,490
And left to right
means x goes

150
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,720
from y squared
over four here,

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,430
22 square root of y.

152
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,980
So the way I'm setting
up this problem here,

153
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,090
and you can set up
easily with edX as well.

154
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,285
But I'm setting up as
an integral dx, d y.

155
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,220
And then the limits
of integration

156
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,330
are determined
by the sketch

157
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,050
of the region here.

158
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,310
Then we just calculate
the integral using

159
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,860
an iterative process
where we hold y

160
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,690
constant and then integrate

161
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,520
the inside as if

162
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,635
y is a constant
with respect to x.

163
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,420
And that means finding
an antiderivative and

164
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,940
using the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

165
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,520
then we can expand
everything out.

166
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,070
And now we just have
a normal polynomial

167
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,770
with respect to
one variable y.

168
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,800
And we would integrate
that in the usual way.

169
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,845
Sometimes were
actually forced

170
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,380
to change the limits
of integration.

171
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,900
Consider this
integral here,

172
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,570
e to the negative
x squared dx d y.

173
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,270
This is a famous example
because let's say we

174
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,620
try to evaluate

175
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,110
this integral just
the way that it is.

176
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,035
Well, that would
mean trying to find

177
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:38,300
an anti-derivative
of the function e to

178
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,255
the negative x squared
with respect to x.

179
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:44,330
And this is a
famous example from

180
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,855
calculus to this is
a Gaussian function.

181
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:48,950
It does not have

182
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,210
an antiderivative

183
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,280
and elementary
antiderivative.

184
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,380
So that's an actual
impossible task.

185
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,240
If we were to
try to evaluate

186
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,280
this integral as
it's written,

187
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,690
we could not use the

188
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,355
fundamental theorem
of calculus.

189
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,120
We would have to use

190
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,770
some numerical
approximation or

191
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,170
something like
that instead.

192
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,410
Well, we can do is
investigate the region of

193
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,540
integration and
see if we can now

194
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,480
rewrite the integral
in terms of dy,

195
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,490
dx and then perhaps

196
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,450
give us a function that

197
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,445
does have an
antiderivative.

198
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,840
So if we sketch

199
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,040
the region of
integration here,

200
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,890
we see that y between 03,

201
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,930
we're going to integrate
x from y to three.

202
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,800
What we'd like
to do is rewrite

203
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,910
the integral and change

204
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,575
the order of integration.

205
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:43,600
So now we can see for
every x between 03,

206
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,830
y is indeed going to be

207
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,660
integrated from 0 to x.

208
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,955
And we see that reflected

209
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,815
in the integral right here.

210
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:56,290
Now, the very first move we

211
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,360
make is the iterated
integral on the inside,

212
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,080
which is the find the

213
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,880
anti-derivative
with respect to y.

214
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,470
Well, e to the
negative x squared

215
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,135
is a constant with
respect to y.

216
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,940
So you just attach a
why to it and then

217
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,080
apply the fundamental
theorem of

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,524
calculus at the endpoints.

219
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,215
And the result
is a function

220
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,750
that now when we

221
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,280
find the antiderivative
with respect to x,

222
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,140
we can do it using
substitution.

223
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,270
We can use the notion of

224
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,470
double integrals to find

225
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,345
the average value
of a function

226
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:29,060
over a region is a
function of two variables.

227
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,475
And here we're just
using the idea that

228
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,160
a function's average
on a region is

229
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,724
the volume underneath
that surface

230
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,940
over the region divided

231
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,080
by the area of the base.

232
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,770
That's an easy way to
remember this formula.
