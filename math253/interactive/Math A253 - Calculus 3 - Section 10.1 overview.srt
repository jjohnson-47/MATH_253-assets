1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,460
Let's talk a
little Cartesian

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,885
coordinates in 3D space.

3
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,250
This is an overview
of section

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,570
10.1 from our book,

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,780
Cartesian coordinates
in 3D space,

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,890
or a way of describing

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,390
the location of a point

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,435
in 3D space with
respect to some origin.

9
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,980
The origin is
usually denoted

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,870
0 comma 0, comma 0.

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,760
It's very similar
to the way

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,350
you describe points
in 2D space,

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,240
except we have an
extra coordinate.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,385
The 0.2 comma
three comma five

15
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:31,410
is two units in
the X direction,

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,490
three units in the Y, and

17
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,155
five units in
the z-direction.

18
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:35,370
And we can have lots of

19
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,570
points and we can have

20
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,450
equations that
describe many points.

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,680
We can also talk about
distance in 3D space.

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,255
If you have two points,

23
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:50,545
the distance between them

24
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:52,300
is given by this formula,

25
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,130
which is the square
root of the sum of

26
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,200
the squares of
the differences

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,745
of the respective
coordinates.

28
00:00:57,745 --> 00:00:59,665
It's very similar to
the distance formula

29
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:00,940
in two dimensions.

30
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,740
In fact, it's just
another application

31
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,510
of the Pythagorean theorem.

32
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,790
Here I show that we
have two points,

33
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,545
1-2-3, 4-5-6.

34
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:10,285
How can you, how do
you find the distance?

35
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:11,710
You put them
into the formula

36
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,270
and calculate like this.

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,390
And a natural object

38
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,550
in three-dimensional
space as a sphere,

39
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,310
which is the set
of points that are

40
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,465
all the same distance

41
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,450
from some point
called a center.

42
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,315
If you have the
center being

43
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:32,000
abc and a radius being r,

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,330
then you can describe
the distance from

45
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,629
the point XYZ to the
point a BC equal to r.

46
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,964
>> That's the
distance formula.

47
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:41,210
>> And if you
square both sides,

48
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,550
you get exactly this
standard equation

49
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,260
of the sphere.

50
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,460
Oftentimes,

51
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,275
you're given an
equation that doesn't

52
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,840
look exactly like
a sphere per se.

53
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,520
But if you group the x, y,

54
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,810
and z terms together,

55
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,400
like we did in
this example,

56
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,260
you can see that
you can complete

57
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,540
the square and
then gather the x,

58
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,725
y, and z squared's.

59
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,930
And then it is
just a sphere.

60
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,055
And this sphere
is centered at

61
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:05,510
negative one comma two,

62
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,830
comma three, With
radius four.

63
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,720
We can also have planes

64
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,865
in three-dimensional space.

65
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:17,480
Here we have three
coordinate planes,

66
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,745
and these are
the most common.

67
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:22,130
The XY plane,
which is the set

68
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,845
of points with
a Z value of 0.

69
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,050
The YZ plane, which is

70
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,465
the set of points
with an x value of 0.

71
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,235
And the X Z plane,

72
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,510
which is a set of points.

73
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,610
What the y value of 0.

74
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,760
These planes help
us describe what's

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,660
happening in these
three cross-sections.

76
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,060
So no matter what kind
of graph we have,

77
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,810
no matter what kind of

78
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,085
function that we're given,

79
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:48,320
we often like to simplify

80
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,360
the situation by
looking at what's

81
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
happening in one of

82
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,775
these three
coordinate planes.

83
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,980
Because then the
three-dimensional graph

84
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,510
just becomes a
two-dimensional graph.

85
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,220
And we can use all
the results that we

86
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,405
know from one-dimensional
calculus.

87
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:04,520
So the equations
for these planes

88
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,230
are z equals to 0,

89
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,940
x equals to 0, and

90
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,350
y equals to 0 respectively.

91
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,545
A cylinder in
three-dimensional space

92
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,000
is a bit more general

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
than what we usually
think of as a cylinder.

94
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,510
A cylinder we
usually think of

95
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,175
as sort of like a tin can,

96
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,510
like we see here in the

97
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,145
picture on the bottom left.

98
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:28,250
In calculus, a cylinder is

99
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,269
A set of parallel lines
grouped together.

100
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,285
>> Essentially, these
are called the rulings.

101
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:36,830
And we can see that

102
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,570
the picture on
the bottom right,

103
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,555
If you have a curve
like a parabola there,

104
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,430
and then you have
all of the lines

105
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,159
that go through
that parabola.

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,990
>> And that surface
that's formed by

107
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,150
all those lines
is a cylinder.

108
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,530
So it's the cylinder

109
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,730
is the surface that you get

110
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,440
by connecting together all

111
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,850
of these parallel lines.

112
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,790
We also describe

113
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,010
the many services in
three-dimensional space

114
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,110
by revolving

115
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,645
other surfaces that
we already know.

116
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:11,000
So in this case,

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,850
we have y equals
the sine of z.

118
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,700
So if you kind of tilt
your head and you

119
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,380
can see that our z

120
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,490
as the independent
variable,

121
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,440
we just have a
normal sine function

122
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,275
there from 0 to pi.

123
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,900
And in the y z plane,

124
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,740
that is what it looks like.

125
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,390
Y equals the sine of z.

126
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,795
And you can rotate that
around the z-axis.

127
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,460
And then you get
nice, you get

128
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,950
this nice TOP
looking surface.

129
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,640
Some important kinds of

130
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,845
surfaces are
quadratic surfaces.

131
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:47,270
A quadric services are

132
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,025
an extension of the idea of

133
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:53,630
conic sections from
precalculus and calculus.

134
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,040
And if you see

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,050
the equation here for
a quadratic surface,

136
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,630
it's very similar to
the general equation of

137
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,970
a conic section when

138
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,964
we sketch quadratic
surfaces,

139
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,450
we have modern software

140
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,290
that helps us quite a bit

141
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,420
these days, but oftentimes,

142
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,000
a simple sketch on
your own can help you

143
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,380
solve a seemingly

144
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,360
intractable problem
in seconds.

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,300
Just by helping you
simplify the situation,

146
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,070
by understanding what kind

147
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,479
of object we're
dealing with.

148
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,130
>> The typical way
that you sketch

149
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,435
a quarter x surface

150
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:31,160
or most surfaces is just to

151
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,974
sketch some cross sections.

152
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:35,165
>> So in a surface
like this,

153
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,135
if this is a hyperbola
or hyperboloid,

154
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:39,260
and the equation of

155
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,090
a hyperboloid
here is given.

156
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,570
And if you want to
graphic yourself,

157
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,190
what you could
do is just let

158
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,455
x be 0, let's say.

159
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:51,305
And if you put x
equals to 0 in,

160
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:53,690
what you're left
with is just a y

161
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,400
squared over b squared

162
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,960
minus z squared over
c squared equal one,

163
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,550
which is a hyperbola.

164
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,620
So when x is equal to 0,

165
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,155
remember that's
the y z plane.

166
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,645
So by setting x equal to 0,

167
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,220
you're looking
at the curve in

168
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,480
the YZ plane of that
part of the surface.

169
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,135
So this is taking
cross sections

170
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:17,120
of the surface in
a systematic way.

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,650
And if the years,

172
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,080
if your graph is
centered at the origin,

173
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,535
which this one is,

174
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:24,230
the typical cross
sections to

175
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,715
take would be the
coordinate axes,

176
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:29,610
x equal to 0, y equal
to 0, and z equal to 0
