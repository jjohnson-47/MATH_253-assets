1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,070
Let's take a
look at Section

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,320
14.1 on an introduction

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,630
to line integrals will

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,979
start with some notation.

5
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:09,360
When were first
introduced to

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,440
definite integrals of

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,345
a function with
one variable,

8
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,279
we often write the
limits of integration

9
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,140
on the bottom
and the top of

10
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,180
the integral
sign to indicate

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,530
that we can use

12
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,525
the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

13
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,270
That will be an
anti-derivative evaluated at

14
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,240
those two places and
then subtracted.

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,590
But when we're
talking about

16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,730
integrals in general,

17
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,010
often the set that
we're integrating over,

18
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,360
in this case the D

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
interval from one to three.

20
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,175
Just write the letter that

21
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:38,570
corresponds to
that interval

22
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,965
underneath the
integral sign.

23
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:42,425
And we've already
seen this when we

24
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,400
first were setting up

25
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,915
double and triple
integrals.

26
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:47,540
Wherever it double
integral we're integrating

27
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,645
over a set in
the plane are,

28
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:52,040
and in triple integrals,

29
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,390
we're integrating
over a set of

30
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,860
points in
three-dimensional space.

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,360
When we're talking
about integrating

32
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,340
over more general sets,

33
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,620
we do the same
thing with we have

34
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,870
a symbol S that
corresponds to a set,

35
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,630
perhaps a curve in
three-dimensional space.

36
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,280
We will write
the set below,

37
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,110
the integral sign
and a function

38
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,795
defined on those set of
points we integrate.

39
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:17,570
And then d whatever,

40
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,340
where that whatever
is a symbol

41
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,795
that refers to

42
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:24,140
how we measure distance
or area or volume,

43
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,880
et cetera, in that set.

44
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,685
Now we are going
to look at a curve

45
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:33,335
C and try to

46
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:35,420
understand how we can
integrate a function

47
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,405
over a curve rather
than an interval.

48
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:40,745
The quiet is the same.

49
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:42,320
If we want to look at

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,065
the area underneath
the function,

51
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:47,450
above the curve, we chop

52
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,090
that curve into
tiny little pieces.

53
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,905
Each has a width, and then

54
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:53,930
the function corresponds
to a height.

55
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,220
And we add all of those,

56
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,330
those pieces up to get

57
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,165
an approximation
of the integral.

58
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:01,880
The nice thing
about intervals is

59
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,750
that it's really easy to

60
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,995
find distance in them.

61
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,210
Alright? The
interval from one to

62
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,325
three is three minus one.

63
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:10,430
And in general, the
interval from a to B

64
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,930
is the distance
or the length

65
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,850
of that integral
is b minus a.

66
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,910
So the math is very easy
to find distances in

67
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,120
intervals when we
have a curve though,

68
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,620
either curve in
the plane or

69
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,075
a curve in
three-dimensional space,

70
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,470
finding those
little bits of

71
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,690
pieces is a bit
more difficult.

72
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,010
And we have to
use arc length.

73
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,840
So the area under
the curve f

74
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,670
is approximated as

75
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,620
the sum all of these widths

76
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,810
and heights over
these small pieces.

77
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,580
And then we take
the pieces to

78
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,305
be smaller and
smaller and smaller,

79
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,645
which is indicated by this

80
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,610
double absolute
value sign here.

81
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,740
As those small arc length
gets minds smarter,

82
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,075
smaller, we ended up,

83
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,160
and that is what
we call the

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,350
integral over the curve
C of the function

85
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,890
S. So this is

86
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,240
the definition of the line

87
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,815
integral which we just saw.

88
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:04,115
And it's important to
understand that this

89
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:07,460
integral is defined in

90
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,665
this way as sort of
an approximation.

91
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:12,095
It's the limit of
these approximations

92
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:13,655
of the area under the,

93
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:15,320
under the curve f over D,

94
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,600
under the function
f over the curve C

95
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,950
Sometimes the curve
that we want to

96
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,140
integrate the function
over is closed,

97
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,220
meaning that it begins and

98
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,945
ends at the same point.

99
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,270
When that's the case,
we usually write

100
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,760
the integral sign with
this little circle in

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,950
it to indicate that
the curve that we're

102
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,260
enter integrating
over is closed.

103
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,370
For the rest of
the examples.

104
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,510
Here, we're going
to assume that

105
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,270
the curve is actually
in the x, y plane.

106
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,910
If we have a curve
in the x-y plane,

107
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,520
we can try to

108
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,925
find the arc length
parameter for the curve.

109
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,400
Parameterized the
parameterize the curve,

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,800
and then find the arc
length parameter.

111
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,380
Recall that the arc
length parameter

112
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,850
is defined as the

113
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,050
integral of the magnitude

114
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,800
of the derivative of

115
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,195
your parameterization
function,

116
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:14,180
where any
parameterization function

117
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,920
as it will work.

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,020
And then if we take
the derivative with

119
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,210
respect to t of both
sides of this equation,

120
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,820
we see that the, that
S prime is really

121
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,400
just the magnitude of

122
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,095
the derivative of
a prioritization.

123
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,790
So if we hit the
refresh button

124
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,990
on our integral here,

125
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,120
we can replace
as prime with

126
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,030
the magnitude of our
parameterization.

127
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,740
And that's what
we see here.

128
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,840
So we can, this will
allows us to get

129
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,310
a nice formula
for calculating

130
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,035
these line integrals.

131
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:43,640
And what we do is we

132
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,335
start with a
parametrization.

133
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,970
We can take its derivative,

134
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,370
find the magnitude
of that derivative,

135
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,250
and then we put the
parameterization pieces,

136
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,460
the X and Y pieces into
the function itself.

137
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,170
And then everything
is in terms

138
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,150
of the variable t
and reintegrate.

139
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,150
Let's look at an
example. Here we have

140
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,800
a surface defined
by the function

141
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,005
f over the x, y plane.

142
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,700
And we would like to know

143
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,000
the line integral
over the curve C,

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,370
where C here is described

145
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,680
as the line in
the xy plane,

146
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
Y equals 2X plus one,

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,490
where x goes between
negative 11.

148
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,105
So the goal is to
parameterize that curve.

149
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,130
And it's a straight line.

150
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,125
So we can parameterize
the curve

151
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,930
with T going from
negative one to one

152
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,600
and just use the function
with our parameter

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
t. We can take

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,290
the derivative and then

155
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,820
find the magnitude
of that vector.

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,230
Then we put our
values for x and

157
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,570
y t and two t
plus one in for x

158
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,715
and y to the function

159
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:52,730
we put an R prime
and then we just,

160
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,905
we have a simple integral.

161
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,620
So 14.418 is

162
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,045
the answer to this
line integral.

163
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,830
Remember what that
number means?

164
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,570
It actually corresponds to

165
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,590
the area below the

166
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,970
function and
above the curve.

167
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,870
Properties of line
integrals are thankfully

168
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,430
familiar to the properties

169
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,945
of other integrals
we've been looking at.

170
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:18,005
We can pull constants
out front and the Lyn,

171
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:20,700
It's separates
over addition.

172
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,540
We can break the curve into

173
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,685
pieces and then integrate

174
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:32,070
over those separate
pieces separately.
