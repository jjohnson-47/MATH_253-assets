1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's take a look at

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,750
the multivariable
chain rule.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,130
>> In section 12.51,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,360
we want to revisit
some things we know

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,564
about the chain rule
from calculus one.

6
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:13,440
>> If we have a
single variable

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,285
function y equals g of x,

8
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:17,760
that gives us the
mileage of the vehicle,

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,265
meaning y gives
us Miles and

10
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:23,819
x is the gallons
of gasoline.

11
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,100
>> And then we also have

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,400
x being a function of t,

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,989
which in this
case is dollar.

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,429
>> So this is a situation

15
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,470
where Y is described as

16
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,010
a composition of
functions g with

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,040
f. If we want to

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,415
know how is the
function wise mileage

19
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:48,995
changing with respect
to the dollar?

20
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:51,870
Then we can use
the chain rule.

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,920
The rate at which the
miles is changing

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,690
with respect
dollar is equal to

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,830
the rate at which
the miles is

24
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,240
changing with respect
to gallons of

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,280
gasoline times
that the ray which

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,360
is changing with respect

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,084
to gasoline with dollars.

28
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,750
>> And the chain rule for

29
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,460
one variable is usually
written like this.

30
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,380
Now the Chain Rule for, for

31
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,790
multivariable functions,

32
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,635
we can think of
the surface of

33
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,589
our graph of a function
of two variables.

34
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:21,755
>> And we want to know
how is that function

35
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:26,480
changing if we have,

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,850
if we're traveling
along that surface as,

37
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,270
let's say, a function
of time t in this case.

38
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,535
So in this example, we have

39
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:37,490
a circle in the domain,

40
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,740
and we can be
travelling around

41
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,935
that circle as a
function of time

42
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,420
of x and t comma y of

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,875
t. But that it

44
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,790
tells us how fast we're

45
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,154
spinning around the circle.

46
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,030
>> We need to use
the information from

47
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,965
the terrain of
the function,

48
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:56,930
or we going up or down

49
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,250
to tell us how fast it's

50
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,840
moving up or down on

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,984
the surface of
the graph itself.

52
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:04,010
>> So this is motivation

53
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,825
for the multi-variable
chain rule,

54
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,430
which says that the rate at

55
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,900
which the elevation
is changing with

56
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,440
respect to time has to
do with the rate at

57
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,510
which you're changing with

58
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,625
respect to x and y axis,

59
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,370
your speed or your velocity

60
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,275
and the terrain itself,

61
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:21,980
which is what the

62
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,210
partial derivative
tells us.

63
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,694
>> So this is the
multivariable chain rule.

64
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,210
>> It's often
remembered with

65
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,204
this convenient
diagram here.

66
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:33,380
>> The derivative
with respect to,

67
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,509
derivative of z
with respect to t.

68
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,610
>> As you go along
the branches and

69
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,110
multiply and then you

70
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,495
add up the result in
the corresponding,

71
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,610
add up the
corresponding branches.

72
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:49,510
>> Here we have an
object traveling

73
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,759
along a path with some
given information.

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,250
>> We know the
partial derivatives,

75
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,630
we know how z is

76
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,370
changing with
respect to x and y.

77
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,990
And then we also
know how x and

78
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,194
y are changing
with respect to t.

79
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:03,100
>> Again, the partial z,

80
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,290
partial x is information

81
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,105
about how steep
the graph is,

82
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,280
those places and dx,

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,644
d t, and d t.

84
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,250
>> So tell us
how fast we're

85
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,480
moving in the x

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,864
and y directions
respectively.

87
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,200
>> So this is

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,835
just a straightforward
application

89
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:20,635
of the multi-variable
chain rule,

90
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,315
and it illustrates the

91
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:24,400
connection between the,

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,140
the terrain and the speed.

93
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,710
>> We can also
have functions

94
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,425
of more than one parameter,

95
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,900
S and T. And if you want

96
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,245
to find how z is changing
with respect to S,

97
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:40,970
you can often
remember it with

98
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,205
a tree diagram like here.

99
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,200
If we want to find
housing is changing as we

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,180
go along the branches
with the S and

101
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,484
multiply and then add
up those branches.

102
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:54,750
>> And then similarly
with respect to t,

103
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,960
there's a nice
side effect with

104
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,790
the multivariable
chain rule that helps

105
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,650
us find implicit
derivatives.

106
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:07,640
>> So let's look at
the case where we have

107
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,294
a function of a couple
of areas equal to 0.

108
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,110
>> And then what
we're gonna do is

109
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,020
set acts as just a
function of itself,

110
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,929
acts as a function of x.

111
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:21,480
>> So we can write
out the chain rule.

112
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,950
But in this case,
the derivative of

113
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,240
z with respect to x and

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,890
z is a constant function 0,

115
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,640
we just get 0 and dx,

116
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,470
dx is just one.

117
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,815
So if we put these
two parts here,

118
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,410
we get that the DY,

119
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,410
DX is just equal
to negative

120
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,270
of the derivative
after select Ax

121
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,354
divided by I drove f
with respect to y.

122
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,680
>> So neat shortcut formula

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,394
for finding DY, DX.

124
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:54,060
>> Let's look
at an example.

125
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,600
>> So given the
implicitly defined

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,725
function here,

127
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:04,410
find Y prime,
which is d by dx.

128
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:07,655
>> The first step is to,

129
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,290
we want to use the
assumptions of

130
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,090
the implicit
differentiation formula.

131
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,055
So if we put everything
on one side,

132
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,140
we now have a
function that's

133
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,630
equal to 0 or equal
to a constant,

134
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,010
we can take the
partial derivatives of

135
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,330
that function with
respect to x,

136
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,454
with respect to y.

137
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,060
>> And just apply
the formula

138
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,740
that dy dx is equal to the

139
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,590
negative of f partial x

140
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,790
divided by f partial y.
