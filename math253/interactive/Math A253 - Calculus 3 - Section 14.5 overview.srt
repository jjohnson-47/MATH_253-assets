1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Let's take a look
at parameterized

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,300
services and service area.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,910
In section 14.5, we've

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,385
already seen
parameterizations of curves,

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,140
curves in
two-dimensional space

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,850
and curves in
three-dimensional space.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,870
Curve is really just

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,569
like a one-dimensional line

9
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,950
that is living in

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,335
a two-dimensional
flat space

11
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:20,730
or maybe moving

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
around in
three-dimensional space.

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,150
But either way, the setup

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,340
is a vector
valued function,

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,740
where every point
along the curve

16
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,080
corresponds to the
terminal value of

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,790
that vector valued
function for

18
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,120
some value in it's
parametrized interval.

19
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,650
So as T ranges,

20
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,640
for example, between 01,

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,330
every terminal point along

22
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,920
that vector R corresponds

23
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,170
to some point
along the curve.

24
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,180
We want to do the
same thing now,

25
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,300
not for linear curves
in two-dimensional,

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,220
three-dimensional
space, but surfaces.

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,760
To talk about surfaces
of two dimension,

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,660
two dimensional surfaces

29
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,950
in three-dimensional space,

30
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,490
we need to have

31
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,920
the concept of
Orient ability.

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,310
So 4N double means that any

33
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,350
field of normal vectors

34
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,405
that we define
on the surface,

35
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,730
that it has to
vary continuously.

36
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,620
And that's sort of
hard to think about.

37
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,630
So what we usually
do is we look at

38
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,565
a non oriental surface

39
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:22,005
and think about what's
happening there.

40
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,295
A famous example is
the Mobius band.

41
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:27,685
If you take a piece
of paper to strip and

42
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:29,380
turn it to a 108
to turn one in

43
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,460
280 degrees and then

44
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,795
glue it back to each other.

45
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:34,465
What you have is the
following picture.

46
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:36,880
And any way you define

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,610
a field of normal vectors
along the surface,

48
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,410
if you start on one part

49
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,435
and traverse along
all the way around

50
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:46,060
back to that same
pot spot we end up

51
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,320
getting is a normal
vector pointing

52
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,985
in the opposite direction.

53
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,380
So that means is that this

54
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,940
surface doesn't
really have an,

55
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,075
have a two different sides.

56
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:57,970
You really has a, was
a one-sided surface.

57
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,010
Well, we, we want to
avoid that problem.

58
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,799
We want to have services
that are two-sided.

59
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,195
So let's parameterize
a surface

60
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,710
given as the graph
of the function z

61
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,195
equals x squared
plus two y squared

62
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:13,190
over this disk
of radius two.

63
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,075
We have to be
careful because we

64
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:17,710
might want to parameterize

65
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,285
this service of you

66
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,730
going between
negative two into V,

67
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,650
going between negative 22

68
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,750
and then just let
the x value b,

69
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,110
you let the y value BV put,

70
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,370
put v and u into

71
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,480
the function to find

72
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,310
the corresponding z value.

73
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,660
And then we have

74
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,970
a parameterization
of the surface.

75
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,200
It's true it is, but it's

76
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,540
the service
above the square

77
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,670
where x goes
between negative

78
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,055
22 and y goes
between negative 22.

79
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:48,060
It's not the surface
above the desk.

80
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
So since we have

81
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,655
a disk with
circular symmetry,

82
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:53,810
where we need to do

83
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,950
is use something like polar

84
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,500
coordinates with
the variables u

85
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,640
and v to describe

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,950
our location
within the desk.

87
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,070
So if we let u be
a variable that

88
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,265
describes the angle
around the desk,

89
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,635
and we let v be the,

90
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:12,275
the polar value,
the radius.

91
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,270
Then what we can do is

92
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,400
describe any point
within the disk with

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,160
following parameterization
to v cosine

94
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,440
nu and 2V sine u.

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,950
So for any value
u between 02 pi,

96
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,930
you are at some angle
around the desk.

97
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,290
And for any value v
from 0 to one. We're

98
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,935
located to v distance
away from the center.

99
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:37,130
So every point in that
desk corresponds to

100
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,775
a single u comma v
in these intervals.

101
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:42,605
Then what you do is use

102
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,420
the hex value of two

103
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,520
v cosine knew the
y-value of two,

104
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
the sign you and put those

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,730
into the function
for z to find

106
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,160
the corresponding
z value in

107
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,010
terms of u and v.
And therefore,

108
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,210
our parameterization

109
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,590
of this particular surface

110
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,910
above the desk
is given here.

111
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,260
This is the trick for

112
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,609
parameterizing surfaces,

113
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,680
where we are trying
to prioritize over

114
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,455
a particular region,
which can be difficult.

115
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:12,080
So what we do is
if your region is

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,640
the x value is bounded

117
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,245
between two
constant values,

118
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:16,940
but the y-values
bounded, let's say,

119
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,205
between two functions of x.

120
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,810
Then you can use this trick

121
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,190
to write down and

122
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,780
nice parametrization
of the surface.

123
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,420
Let's parameterize
this cylinder.

124
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,740
So this is a cylinder,

125
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,545
it's not exactly round.

126
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:38,280
You have it's higher
here than it is wide.

127
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,810
So one way to
think about it is

128
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,150
any point on the surface
of this cylinder,

129
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,000
He's really defined
by two directions.

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,520
There's the direction
that's sort of

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,340
the angle around
the skewer.

132
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,510
Here. The y-axis is,

133
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,610
goes through the center and

134
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,630
then you have a direction

135
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,385
which is along the y-axis

136
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,005
or the length of
the cylinder.

137
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:01,955
And that's sort of
the inspiration

138
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,880
to use the following
parametrization.

139
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,360
If we let u correspond

140
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,620
to an any value between

141
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,435
02 pi then and
for any fixed y,

142
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,180
a location along
that slice that's

143
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,700
parallel to the z-axis is

144
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,250
described by cosine nu two

145
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,890
sine U in the z components.

146
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,820
So that's nice. So
for any fixed y,

147
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,990
we can describe any point

148
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,120
along the outside of
the cylinder that way.

149
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,850
But then we just for
the y value will

150
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,365
parameterize it with v

151
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,480
going between negative 11,

152
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,260
because those defined

153
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,730
the endpoints
of the cylinder

154
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,770
that will describe
the location

155
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,075
lengthwise of the cylinder.

156
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:45,770
So any point on the surface

157
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,285
now can be described

158
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:49,500
with this parameterization.

159
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,430
We also want to
be able to find

160
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,145
the surface area of
our parameterizations.

161
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,210
To do this, we'll use,

162
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,380
it's kinda the
same idea that we

163
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,795
used to find areas
of planar curves.

164
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:01,880
So if we had a
region in the plane,

165
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,790
we could find the area
of that region by

166
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,020
taking the double
integral of

167
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,210
the value one
over the region.

168
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,280
And the whole
idea is we find

169
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,780
the area by summing

170
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,010
up little pieces of

171
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,215
the area da over
the region.

172
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,060
Only the difference is
now we're going to sum

173
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,670
up little pieces of
surface area ds.

174
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,660
If we have a
function and we

175
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,715
take a look at a small
piece of it's graph,

176
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:28,070
we can pull out a
tiny little rectangle

177
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,920
that approximates
the service area.

178
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,380
And we'll remember if that,

179
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,760
if we have two vectors that

180
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,100
are tangent to the surface,

181
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,260
then the magnitude of

182
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,120
the cross-product gives us

183
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,860
the area of the
parallelogram.

184
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,960
So we use the magnitude

185
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,830
of the cross product of

186
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,530
these two tangent
vectors to

187
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,905
estimate the surface
area and a small piece.

188
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,060
And then what we do is we

189
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,050
take the pieces to be

190
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,565
smaller and smaller
and smaller,

191
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:56,795
add them all up.

192
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:58,190
And that's how we're
going to define

193
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,900
our service area integral.

194
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,460
So let's take a look
at the same example

195
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,080
that we just looked
at with the cylinder.

196
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,420
We have the parametrization
that we found.

197
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,985
Let's find the
surface area.

198
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:14,015
The first thing we
need to do is take

199
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:16,775
the derivatives of
our parametrization.

200
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,800
So you take the
derivative with

201
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,470
respect to u of all
three components,

202
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,970
take the derivative
with respect to

203
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,725
v of all three components.

204
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,030
We find the cross product

205
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,710
of those two vectors.

206
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,390
Then we find the magnitude

207
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,130
of that cross product.

208
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,720
And then we write down

209
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,190
the surface area integral.

210
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,940
We know that our
function of the mind to

211
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,890
the cross product
we just found.

212
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,680
And since we
are integrating

213
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,280
u from 0 to two pie
and v from 0 to one.

214
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,319
That gives us our
limits of integration

215
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,255
and we can calculate
that integral.

216
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:53,910
And it turns out
to be about 53.6
