00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,184
Hi class.

2
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:03,284
>> Let's talk about
vector valued functions

3
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:05,650
from Section 11.1,

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,610
vector valued
functions, or functions

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,085
whose output is a vector.

6
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,605
Here we see some
examples of

7
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:14,820
vector valued functions in

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,430
two dimensions and
in three dimensions.

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,900
So a vector valued

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,525
function is
still a function

11
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:23,700
of a real variable t,

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,620
but its output is now

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,810
a vector and has
two components.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,570
And the nice thing is,
is that the components

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,339
of the output
vector R functions,

16
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:35,150
we normally see
them, they are real,

17
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,500
real valued functions as

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000
they are in Calculus
One and Two.

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,165
Here's a curve y
equal to x squared.

20
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,055
We're pretty familiar
with this one.

21
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:47,809
We want to describe

22
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,785
this curve with a
vector valued function.

23
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,870
One way to do it is to

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,280
parameterize the curve.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,330
This is a concept
that we'll

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,470
be seeing over and over

27
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,320
again by parameterizing
the curve.

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,999
We have something
called a parameter.

29
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:02,704
>> T.

30
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,010
>> T is our new variable.

31
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,705
>> You can think
of it as time.

32
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:08,300
And we want to describe
the location of

33
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,520
the point x comma y for

34
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,990
any value of t.

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,050
Here we can see
that if we put

36
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,455
the x value and the y
value into a vector,

37
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,030
that gives us a
vector valued

38
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,654
function that
describes the curve.

39
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:28,190
>> So every value

40
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,094
of t gives us a
different vector.

41
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,420
>> And that different
vector corresponds

42
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,879
to the blue arrow
that you see here.

43
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,844
>> And notice that
the curve itself

44
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:38,180
is traced out by the

45
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,320
terminal point
of the arrow.

46
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,809
>> So what if we have
a new parameter s?

47
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:47,074
>> S is equal to two t.

48
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,979
>> What does that
curve look like?

49
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,960
>> If we were to
have the vector

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,480
valued function r of ask,

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,680
ask comma S squared.

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,059
>> The fact is it's
actually the same.

53
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,560
>> So this shows
that we can have

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,885
multiple parameterizations

55
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,655
for the same curve.

56
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:09,150
You'll notice here, if
S is equal to two t,

57
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,930
the rate at which a point

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,100
will move along
the curve will be

59
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,940
twice as fast it
with respect to t,

60
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,110
with respect to time,

61
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,805
if we're thinking
of T at time.

62
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,080
So that's going to do,

63
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,890
we're going to be
something that's

64
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,110
important in
later chapters is

65
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,580
that we can have

66
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,780
different parameterizations

67
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,665
for the same curve.

68
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:28,430
And that makes sense.

69
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,310
If the curve is the
path of an object,

70
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,945
that path can
be moving fast,

71
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,430
that or that object
can be moving faster,

72
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,675
that object can
be moving slowly.

73
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,760
Our curves in
two-dimensional space can be

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,230
quite exotic
and interesting

75
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,100
like we have here.

76
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,340
So this is an entire
subject unit of itself,

77
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,890
really is just
studying curves in

78
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,900
two-dimensional
space and describing

79
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,235
them with vector equations.

80
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:56,170
The vector equations for
this one is actually

81
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,970
just too complicated,
even put on the screen.

82
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,530
We can also describe curves

83
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,580
in three-dimensional space.

84
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,620
This way, the
only difference

85
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,315
is there's a
third component.

86
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:09,265
The picture that
you see here

87
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,440
is the curve of cosine t,

88
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,810
sine t comma t. And we'll

89
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,915
remember from calculus
that cosine t,

90
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:18,400
sine t is, are

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,965
spinning around
the unit circle.

92
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,235
So if you were to look
at this curve from,

93
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,050
from the top and
look down and

94
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,540
just see the x and y axis.

95
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,595
Any point as t,

96
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,350
as t moves,

97
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,570
the vector would
just be rotor Chang,

98
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,145
rooting around in a circle.

99
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,455
But now we have a
third component, t,

100
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:37,610
which corresponds to

101
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,090
the z component
of the curve.

102
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,950
So the parametric equations

103
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,060
here would be cosine t,

104
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,165
sine t t. So for
any value of t,

105
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:51,030
we get a yellow arrow,
and that's our vector.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,205
And so as the t
value increases,

107
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,930
the vectors that we get

108
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,220
correspond to the
yellow vector

109
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,074
that you see here.

110
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:00,590
>> And its terminal
point is along

111
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:08,904
the curve with vector
valued functions.

112
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,795
>> Since the outputs
are vectors,

113
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:12,370
we can do all of
the things that we

114
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,275
did in Chapter
ten with vectors.

115
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,030
We can add them, we
can subtract them,

116
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,890
we can take their
dot products,

117
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,270
cross products,
all those things.

118
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,890
Here's a famous example

119
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,960
of something
called a cyclone.

120
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,570
So the cycle, it
is a graph that's

121
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,165
traced by a point rolling
along the circle.

122
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:34,750
And the question asks
us to find a vector

123
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,055
valued function that
models this curve.

124
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:42,100
Now this can be done
a number of ways,

125
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,850
but I'm going to show you

126
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,019
the way I thought about it.

127
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,789
>> Wishes to first

128
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,380
modeled the point just

129
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,474
spinning around a circle.

130
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,770
>> So if there's something
that's hard to do,

131
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,880
the best thing to
do is to think

132
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,380
of the easiest case.

133
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,270
The easiest case
that I can think

134
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,430
of is if you just have

135
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,885
a circle of radius
1 spinning around,

136
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,790
because we're
gonna have this

137
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,990
ball roll to the right.

138
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,270
I had the point
start down here

139
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,689
on the bottom angle
three pi over two.

140
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,565
>> And if we were just to

141
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,365
add our parameter t,

142
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,805
that just adds an angle

143
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,350
that would spin
around the circle,

144
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,070
but that would spin

145
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,154
around the circle
counterclockwise.

146
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,855
>> And we'll, we want
this to spin clockwise.

147
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,280
So that's why we

148
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,065
have minus t in
the function.

149
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,495
So this vector
valued function here

150
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,090
describes movement

151
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,410
around the circle
like this.

152
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,090
So now we just need
to do the next steps

153
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,610
of turning it into the
cycle that we see.

154
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,550
We can translate the circle

155
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,720
up one unit by just

156
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,970
adding one to the
previous function

157
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,410
in the y component.

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,955
And then to make
the circle move,

159
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,860
to make the whole
animation move to

160
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,000
the right is to add t
to the x component.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,639
So for every t value,

162
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,279
that's just horizontally
translating

163
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,110
the entire circle to
the right by a value

164
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,310
of t. And therefore,

165
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,515
this is one way to
describe how to make,

166
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:16,480
how to curve, to

167
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,770
describe the curve
of the cycle

168
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,000
it with a vector
valued function.

169
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,680
Another important
concept, especially in

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,945
physics, is disc
displacement.

171
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:29,815
So say you have this
green curve shown here,

172
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:33,430
and we know it's described
in a vector valued

173
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,005
function and we know

174
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,790
its position at
a certain time,

175
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,380
times 0, and then we know

176
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,150
its position at
a later time,

177
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,190
let's say time one.

178
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,950
So oftentimes we want
to know where, well,

179
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,660
what was the change in

180
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,955
the position between
these two times?

181
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:49,750
And that gives us

182
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,430
something called
displacement,

183
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,730
which we can describe
with a vector

184
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,390
as the terminal vector

185
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,340
minus the initial vector,

186
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,095
and that tells us the

187
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,730
total displacement
over that time.

188
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,690
Finally, the fight.

189
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,980
Now that we have
displacement,

190
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,970
we can start talking about

191
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,620
the average change of

192
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,695
a vector valued function
over an interval.

193
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:14,750
This is an extension
of average value

194
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,490
of change from
calculus one.

195
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,590
When we're talking
about on average,

196
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,700
how much does a function

197
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,545
change over an interval?

198
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,030
Will usually you look
at the difference in

199
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,950
the function's
value divided

200
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,140
by the total
amount of time.

201
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,060
And it turns out
that this is exactly

202
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,950
the same with vector
valued functions.

203
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,540
Only now our functions are

204
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,340
vector valued
functions rather

205
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,480
than real valued functions.
