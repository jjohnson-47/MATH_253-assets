1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,190
Let's take a look at planes

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,269
in three-dimensional space.

3
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,590
>> This is an
overview of section

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,820
10.6 from her book.

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,050
A plane in
three-dimensional

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,490
space is thought of

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,600
as an infinitely

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,224
large 2-dimensional
flat sheet.

9
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,830
>> Every plane has

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,239
what's called
normal vectors.

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,560
>> It's represented
by the nail

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,389
that you see in
the picture here.

13
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,520
>> Normal vectors
are vectors that

14
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,259
are orthogonal
to the plane.

15
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,030
>> The plane itself

16
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,250
is a collection
of points q,

17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,890
in this case, such
that the vector

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,134
PQ is orthogonal to
this normal vector.

19
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,470
>> So if you have

20
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,930
a normal vector
and a point p,

21
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,205
then the plane
is all points Q,

22
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,270
such that the
dot product of

23
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,490
PQ with the normal
vector is equal to 0.

24
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,270
>> So if we have
a point P with

25
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,470
coordinates x-naught,

26
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,510
y-naught, Z naught, and X.

27
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,370
>> And Q has
coordinates x, y, z.

28
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,574
And the normal vector
has components ABC.

29
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:03,410
>> Then we can take
that equation expanded

30
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,424
out and will imply
the dot product.

31
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,630
>> And that gives us
this formula right here,

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,819
which is the standard
form of a plane.

33
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,920
>> The thing to take
away here is that

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,010
the normal vector is

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,324
right in the equation
of the plane a, B, C.

36
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:20,555
>> They are the
coefficients

37
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,160
that in front of x,

38
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,839
y, and z respectively.

39
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:26,045
>> And a point on the plane

40
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,010
we can see is x-naught,

41
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,315
y-naught, and Z naught.

42
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,775
If you substitute
x naught for x,

43
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:32,990
y naught for y z,

44
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,600
not z, you get 0 plus
0 plus 0, which is 0.

45
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:39,710
>> You can expand
this out in

46
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,290
distribute a and b and
c across the terms.

47
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,810
And then a and b
and c are numbers.

48
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,875
And so our x, y,

49
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,614
x naught, y naught,
and z naught.

50
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:48,950
>> Gather all
those together,

51
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,880
put them on the other side,

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,350
and call that D. That gives

53
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,910
us another form
of the plane.

54
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,870
>> An example, write

55
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,250
the equation of the plane
that passes through

56
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,214
the points 11012,
negative 1012.

57
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:05,150
>> The strategy here is

58
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,200
to use the three points,

59
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,550
define two vectors that

60
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,260
are parallel
with the plane,

61
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,730
then define the
normal vector.

62
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,180
>> We just take

63
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,910
the cross-product of
those two vectors.

64
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,100
I found that, I found
the vectors PQ and PR.

65
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,720
Those are two
vectors that are

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,115
parallel with the plane.

67
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:23,660
If you take the
cross product of

68
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,819
those two, I got 211.

69
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,234
>> And then a point
on the plane is 110.

70
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:29,675
>> Now we have
a normal vector

71
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,174
and a point on the plane.

72
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:32,750
>> So we can just
put that into

73
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,579
the standard form
for a plane.

74
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,380
>> And then we have our
equation for a plane.

75
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,860
>> Give the
parametric equations

76
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,460
of a line that is

77
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,630
the intersection

78
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,160
of the two planes
that you see here.

79
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,170
>> The strategy is to find

80
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,610
a direction vector for

81
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,259
the line of intersection.

82
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:51,550
>> So we could start

83
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,780
by adding and subtracting

84
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,100
the equations to each other

85
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,884
and trying to
eliminate variables.

86
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,670
>> But it's really
handy to notice

87
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,920
that the direction
vector of

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,780
the intersection line has

89
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,165
to be orthogonal to
the first plane,

90
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:05,560
and it has to be
orthogonal to the

91
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,060
section plane,
the second plane.

92
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,009
So it has to be
orthogonal to both.

93
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,080
>> And since both
planes give us

94
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,615
the normal vectors,
and in this case,

95
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,775
the normal vector of
plane one is one,

96
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,830
negative 11, and
the normal vector

97
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,575
of 0.2 is negative 211.

98
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,765
We can take the
cross product,

99
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,820
which is negative
two, negative three,

100
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,960
negative one, to find the

101
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,794
direction vector
to the plane.

102
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,510
>> So it's common if

103
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,740
you take the cross
product and you

104
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,240
find a possible direction

105
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,320
vector for the plane,

106
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,899
for, I'm sorry, for
the intersection line.

107
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,870
>> You can scale it
however you wish to find

108
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,430
another direction
vector that's

109
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,754
parallel or the same line.

110
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,510
>> So if in this case,

111
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,010
all three were negative by

112
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,020
multiplying times
negative one,

113
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,925
that changes
the orientation

114
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:50,975
of the direction vector,

115
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,280
but it's still the same

116
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,645
direction as the line.

117
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,460
So I'm taking the
direction vector to be

118
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,799
231 because the
numbers are nicer.

119
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,125
>> The same thing
can be done if

120
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,670
you had some
messy fractions

121
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,780
and you wanted
to just scale it

122
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,195
by a least common multiple,

123
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,710
and that would remove
all the fractions.

124
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,770
>> Now we just need to find

125
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,879
a point on the line.

126
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,330
>> Here.

127
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,930
>> I subtracted

128
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,640
the two equations
to eliminate Z,

129
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,150
and I was left with

130
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,354
3x minus two, i minus one.

131
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:17,450
>> Since there are

132
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,980
three variables
and two equations,

133
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,720
we're free to let
one variable,

134
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240
the free I chose
x equals to 0,

135
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,980
that gives us y is
equal to negative one.

136
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,360
And we substitute,
substitute

137
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,500
those into the
first equation.

138
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,569
I get z is equal to
negative three halves.

139
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,460
>> So a point in

140
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,710
both of the planes
that I found was 0,

141
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,719
negative 1.5, and
negative three-halves.

142
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,399
>> We have a point
on the plane.

143
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,570
>> We have the
direction vector

144
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,964
that we found previously.

145
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,480
>> So we can put that into

146
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,865
the parametric
equations of a plane,

147
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,789
which of parity
equations for a line.

148
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,380
>> And that gives
us the equation

149
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,400
for the intersection line.

150
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,060
Something else
we'll need to

151
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,930
do is be able to find

152
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,644
the distance from a
point to a plane.

153
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,985
>> Here, if you take a
look at the picture,

154
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,925
if we have a point
q not on a plane,

155
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:05,330
we can find the distance
h to the plane,

156
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,444
which is the shortest
distance to the plane.

157
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:10,430
>> And notice that that
shortest distance is

158
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,690
in the same direction as

159
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,909
the normal vector
for the plane.

160
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:16,790
>> So if we take any
point on the plane,

161
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,329
in this case p,
form the vector PQ.

162
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:23,000
>> Then take the
vector projection of

163
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,340
PQ onto the normal vector

164
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,440
that's going to give
us a vector that has

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,940
the same length as

166
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,979
the height that we're
trying to find.

167
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,050
>> And so that's
the formula for

168
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,774
the distance from a
point to a plane.

169
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,260
>> It's the magnitude of

170
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,140
the projection
of PQ onto n,

171
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,835
where p is any
point on the plane,

172
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,170
Q is the point
off the plane,

173
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,059
and n is the normal
vector to the plane.

174
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,320
>> It simplifies it to a

175
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,880
nice expression like this.
