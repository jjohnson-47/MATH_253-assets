1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,315
Let's take a look at

2
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:02,589
arc length and curvature.

3
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:03,850
>> This is an
overview of Section

4
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,780
11.51 and motivation.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,670
When we want to describe

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,205
the position of an
object around a curve,

7
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:13,180
we can do it

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,520
with a different
parameterizations.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,385
So on the pictures
on the bottom left,

10
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,605
we have one
parameterization

11
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:23,770
that shows that at
time equals to 0,

12
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,570
where at this
red point, time

13
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,620
equals to one here.

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,570
At time equals to two here.

15
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,520
Looking at the points as

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,320
t moves gives
us some kind of

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,255
indication of the speed

18
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:37,195
that the position
changes along the curve.

19
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:39,925
On the curve on the right,

20
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,820
S denotes arc length.

21
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,015
So here, when S is 0,

22
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:48,730
if you move one distance
along the curve,

23
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,065
you get S equal to one.

24
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,330
We move one more distance
along the curve,

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,935
we get S equal to two.

26
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,680
So the parametrization
on the left gives us

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,560
a parameterization
in terms at a time.

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,300
Unit t, the premises

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:01,810
realization on

30
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,670
the right because
of privatization.

31
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,080
In terms of the arc length,

32
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,345
the distance S. To
understand arc length,

33
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,790
let's start with
a curve and

34
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,140
remember that we
can have different

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,520
parameterizations.

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,440
The example here is

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,180
if you have the curve
y equals x squared,

38
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,785
which is the
well-known parabola.

39
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:22,600
We can parameterize
that curve with

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,975
a position vector
t comma t squared.

41
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,330
Or we could do it with
this vector here,

42
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,460
two t for t squared.

43
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,430
The difference is, is
that the second one,

44
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,110
an object will move much

45
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,225
faster compared
to the first.

46
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,980
But at the end of the day,

47
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,570
they're tracing
the same curve,

48
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,280
y equals x squared.

49
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,185
When we're finding
arc length,

50
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,160
we can actually start

51
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,975
with any parameterization.

52
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:49,180
So you're doing
calculations is probably

53
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,930
a good idea to start with

54
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,100
the simplest one possible.

55
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,410
So then the arc length
of the curve along

56
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,030
the interval 0 to t is

57
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,355
given by the
following expression.

58
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,020
It's the integral from 0 to

59
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,270
t of the magnitude of the

60
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,635
derivative. So
here's an example.

61
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:12,995
Here's a position
vector along a curve.

62
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:14,750
Let's find the
parameterization

63
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,920
with respect to
the arc length

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,830
S. First we take
its derivative.

65
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,540
Then the arc length is
the integral from 0 to

66
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,330
t of the magnitude
of r prime.

67
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,600
There's a small typo
here, should be R prime.

68
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,240
And that's the square
root of this sum of

69
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,250
the squares of
the components.

70
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,470
And so we end up getting
that the arc length

71
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,900
S is equal to five
t. We can use

72
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,700
the relationship
between S and

73
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,850
T to solve for t and then

74
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,680
substitute that back in to

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,320
the original
parametrization to

76
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,795
get the permutations
in terms of s.

77
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,640
So here, if we solve for t,

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,915
we get S over five.

79
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,820
And if you put S
O S divided by

80
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,205
five in for t into the
original function,

81
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,440
we get this new
parameterization

82
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,730
in terms of the arc length

83
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,520
s. And this
parameterization

84
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,350
has a number of
benefits as we'll see.

85
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,110
So let's investigate this

86
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,580
arc length parameter
a little bit.

87
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,850
If we take the derivative
of both sides of

88
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,380
the definition of

89
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,050
the arc length,
that gives us this.

90
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,970
This tells us that
the rate at which

91
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,530
the arc length changes

92
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,975
is simply the magnitude
of the derivative.

93
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,555
Well, this is what
we called speed.

94
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:34,160
So the derivative of,

95
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,875
the derivative of
the arc length

96
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,720
with respect to
time is the speed.

97
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,665
If we apply the chain rule

98
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,910
and we take the
derivative of

99
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,190
the position vector
function with respect to

100
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,010
time, we get the following.

101
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,945
And then you can solve for

102
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,940
the derivative of

103
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,540
the curve with
respect to s,

104
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,600
And that gives us the
unit tangent vector.

105
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,665
So the arc length

106
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,020
is actually the
parameterization,

107
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,850
which is the one
that always moves at

108
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,770
a constant velocity of one.

109
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,620
Curvature is the
measure of how

110
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,450
much a curve bends.

111
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,490
It's actually a
measure of how much

112
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,250
the unit tangent
vector is turning.

113
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,980
Once you've

114
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,630
parameterised your
curve with respect

115
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,895
to the arc length
parameter.

116
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,400
We can find the
curvature by taking

117
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,010
the magnitude of
the derivative

118
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,240
of the unit tangent vector.

119
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,390
It turns out in certain
situations when

120
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,465
the curve is described
in different ways,

121
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,070
if flicker in number
one, if the curve is

122
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,545
described just y as
a function of x,

123
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,460
you can easily find

124
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,650
the curvature with
this formula.

125
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,020
If you're just curve
is described with

126
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,370
our parameterization and

127
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,065
are in two-dimensional
space.

128
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:59,315
You can find it with
number two here.

129
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,190
And then if it's defined

130
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,080
by a general vector
valued function,

131
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,895
you can use number three.

132
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,340
These three formulas just

133
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,750
involve some, some algebra.

134
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,170
So here's an example.

135
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,490
Find the curvature
of a circle with

136
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,040
radius r given by this.

137
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,030
This is a circle

138
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,320
spinning
counterclockwise with

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,760
radius r. Since the curve

140
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,674
is given to us in this
form, x of t, y of t.

141
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,430
>> We can use option two in

142
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:37,595
the previous slide
in our problem,

143
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:39,200
X is equal to r cosine t,

144
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,074
y is equal to r sine t.

145
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,055
>> So you can find
its derivatives

146
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:45,050
and squares and

147
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,400
then plug it with
all of that into

148
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,684
the formula for
the curvature.

149
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,440
>> And when you
plug that all,

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
then you end up
getting that

151
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,710
the curvature
is one over r.

152
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,445
>> So unsurprisingly,

153
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,950
the curvature
of a circle of

154
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,860
radius r is inversely

155
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,870
proportional to the
radius of the circle.

156
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,660
So the bigger the
circle gets smaller,

157
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,070
the curvature
is going to be,

158
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,990
the smaller the radius,

159
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,640
the larger the curvature
is going to be.
