1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's take a look at
a quick overview of

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,235
section 12.3 on
partial derivatives.

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,170
Partial derivatives of

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,910
a function of
two variables,

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,070
then the function
must be continuous,

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,035
are defined as the limit of

7
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,195
the difference
quotient, where the,

8
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:18,165
the limit is taken
as h goes to 0,

9
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,750
where h is added to
the X component before

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,505
the derivative with
respect to x and

11
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:24,690
the y component for the

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,400
derivative with
respect to Y.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,440
If you're taking the
partial derivative

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,000
of a function of
two variables,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,710
then it's partial
derivatives

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,125
are also functions
of two variables.

17
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,155
Let's take a look
at an example.

18
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:38,700
Here we're asked to

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,930
find the partial
derivative with

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,325
respect to x using
the limit definition.

21
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:43,820
But since we looked at

22
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,500
the definition and why

23
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,670
was acting as a constant,

24
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,110
we can take the
derivative of

25
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,850
this function
with respect to

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,920
x by thinking of
y as a constant.

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,135
So if y is a constant,

28
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,790
the derivative x
squared y is 2x y,

29
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,820
the derivative of
2x is just two.

30
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,990
And the derivative
of y cubed,

31
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,950
if y was acting

32
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,660
of the continent
would just be 0.

33
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,595
So that's the easy way

34
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:06,350
to find the partial
derivatives.

35
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,004
Now using the
limit definition,

36
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:12,019
we have to apply the
definition in the limit.

37
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,050
>> And then we put
an x plus h for

38
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,030
everywhere we see x for

39
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,470
the first part of
the expression.

40
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,385
>> Then we subtract
the function.

41
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:24,440
We need to expand all,

42
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,500
all that out,
gather our terms,

43
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,400
and some magic

44
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,630
happens where
everything that's left

45
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,890
over that doesn't
get cancelled

46
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,600
out has an H and the top,

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,620
the H on the top

48
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,910
cancels with h
on the bottom.

49
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,510
And then when you take

50
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,085
the limit as h goes to 0,

51
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,005
you are left with 2x,

52
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:43,550
2x y plus 2x,

53
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,990
which exactly the way that

54
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,460
we thought about it
in the first place.

55
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,300
Now we want to

56
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,010
interpret some
partial derivatives.

57
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,000
So find the partial

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,020
derivative with
respect to x

59
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,270
and y at the 0.2 comma one.

60
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,120
So first we find the
partial derivatives.

61
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,935
Then we put in the points.

62
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:02,120
Here we see the
partial with

63
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,680
respect to x is
negative three,

64
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,180
with respect to y is one.

65
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,140
What does the
negative three mean?

66
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,030
Well, it's the
instantaneous rate of

67
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,970
the function with respect

68
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,125
to the first variable.

69
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,359
That's one interpretation,
interpretation.

70
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,640
>> It's also the slope

71
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,529
or the steepness
of the function.

72
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,670
>> If you were to face in

73
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,650
the positive
x-direction and take

74
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,230
a one unit step forward.

75
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,720
So is talking about
how that function is

76
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
changing in the
positive x direction.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
So in this case,

78
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,220
if you were to take
one step forward,

79
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,590
you would take
three steps down.

80
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,450
Sort of describes
the steepness

81
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,355
of the function in
that direction.

82
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:43,200
And similar for
the variable y.

83
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,015
So it's the slope of
the tangent line,

84
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,935
although we're talking
about a surface now,

85
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,900
it's the slope of
the tangent line

86
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,795
that's tangent in
that direction.

87
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:56,525
Here we see a couple
of pictures of

88
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,700
the tangent line in

89
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,490
the positive x direction
on the left and

90
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,600
the slope of the
tangent line in

91
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,280
the positive y
direction on the right,

92
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,984
we also have second
partial derivatives.

93
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,950
And if we take

94
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,500
the derivative respect
to x and then x again,

95
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,665
we use this del notation,

96
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,485
which was kind of
a funny-looking D.

97
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,540
And sometimes we write it

98
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,579
with the little acts
as a subscript.

99
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,170
The thing to notice with

100
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,330
the partial
derivative notation

101
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,100
here is that if
you're using

102
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,020
the, the fraction notation,

103
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,150
Leibniz's notation
sometimes called

104
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,470
the derivatives that work

105
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,480
from right to left

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,560
in terms of the order

107
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,880
in which you are
taking them.

108
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,830
So if we look at
number two here,

109
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,255
this function here,

110
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,370
we took the derivative
with respect to x,

111
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,720
then we took the derivative

112
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,995
with respect to y.

113
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,380
So when you see
this fraction

114
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,035
here was first x, then y.

115
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,420
But if you're going
to use the notation

116
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,935
on the right with
the subscripts.

117
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,495
It reads from
left to right,

118
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:01,980
first x, then y.

119
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,925
We want to be
able to interpret

120
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:08,785
second derivatives of

121
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,420
functions of two
variables in the same way

122
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,805
that we do it for
functions of one variable.

123
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:15,670
If you're looking in
only one direction,

124
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,365
the positive x direction.

125
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,120
And in fact, if
you just take

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,200
the cross section of

127
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,330
the graph in
that direction,

128
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,715
in the positive
x direction,

129
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:26,110
then you would
interpret the

130
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,429
second derivative

131
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,830
nearly the same as you
would in calculus one.

132
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,665
It's the rate at which
the slope is changing.

133
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:33,550
And it measures

134
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,140
the concavity in
that direction.

135
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,920
In the same thing for

136
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,305
the second derivative
with respect to y.

137
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:44,750
The mixed partial
derivatives R a little

138
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,200
bit more, more interesting.

139
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,540
So you want to
measure if you're

140
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,620
taking the derivative
with respect to

141
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,690
x and then y,

142
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,910
that's measuring how much

143
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,290
the function is
changing with

144
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,780
the function f of
x is changing with

145
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,220
respect to y as

146
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,275
x derivative with
respect to y.

147
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:05,060
The author in our book has

148
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,605
a really good analogy.

149
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,260
And I encourage you to
look at on page 706 on

150
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,450
the rolling
meadow functions

151
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,450
of three variables
are very similar.

152
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,720
It's the partial
derivative with respect

153
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
to any variable
x or y or z is

154
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,480
this limit of the
difference quotient where

155
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,620
the H is added to

156
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,730
the component in which

157
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,845
you're taking the
derivative of.

158
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:33,110
Interpretive
interpretations of

159
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,790
the derivative
are the same,

160
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,810
although the geometry is

161
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,430
slightly different
because the graph of

162
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,080
the function and here

163
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,580
is in four-dimensional
space.

164
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,340
But in terms of
rates of change in

165
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,500
that particular
direction than

166
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,700
the interpretations
are the same.
