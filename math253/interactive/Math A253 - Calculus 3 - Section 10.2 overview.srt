00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,415
Welcome to a short video

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:03,900
on an introduction
to vectors.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,610
There's a section
10.2 in our book.

4
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,930
>> Factors can be
thought about simply

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,179
as arrows and calculus.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,595
>> We call a vector a
directed line segment.

7
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,740
So that is part
of a line between

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,170
two points and it
has a direction,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,880
meaning we want to
think of moving from

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,110
a certain initial point

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,475
to the terminal point.

12
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,050
Once we have the
initial point

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,845
and a terminal point,

14
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,259
the vector has a
length or magnitude,

15
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,550
and the direction is just

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,600
the direction that
it's pointing.

17
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,200
Some notation that we use

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
for vectors is this.

19
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,965
So if we know
the two points

20
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,685
that the vector goes from,

21
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:44,255
then we can write the
vector has the first,

22
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:46,955
then the second with
an arrow over the top.

23
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:49,025
It matters which order

24
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,150
the points appear, right?

25
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,710
That was the vector PQ

26
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,885
is different than
the vector QP.

27
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:56,780
All vectors that point
in the same direction

28
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,070
and have the same length

29
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,180
are actually the same.

30
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,440
So we can think
of vectors as

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,390
arrows that we
simply just move

32
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,570
around wherever
we want to sense.

33
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,470
It doesn't really matter

34
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,580
where the vector
is pointing.

35
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,560
Usually we drop the points

36
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,420
and we just write
the vector as

37
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,760
v or w or u

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,780
or something like that with

39
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,865
a little arrow
over the top.

40
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:19,550
The length or magnitude
of a vector is

41
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,840
written with this double

42
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,100
absolute value notation.

43
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,830
In math, we usually
write vectors as

44
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,305
components with these
angle brackets.

45
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:33,155
So in R2, or in
two-dimensional space,

46
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,420
a vector is written
as angle bracket

47
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,134
a comma b, another
angle bracket.

48
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:40,880
>> And that's in the
specific case where

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,470
the vector goes from

50
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,829
0 comma 0 to the
point a comma b.

51
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,230
>> We also use this
other notation

52
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,030
for vectors that
you'll see is very

53
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,520
common as either
a row vector

54
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
or a column vector.

55
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,660
That is when we're
using vectors in

56
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,550
the context of
matrices usually.

57
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,260
So how do we find

58
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,970
the component
form of vector?

59
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,020
Well, if we're given
two points from p to q,

60
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,800
then we can find
the vector by

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,945
subtracting the
initial points

62
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:16,654
from the terminal points.

63
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,725
>> So in the picture
that you see here,

64
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:21,409
we have a vector that
goes from a to B.

65
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,255
>> And if you subtract

66
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:25,430
the initial points from a,

67
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,490
that essentially
translates that vector

68
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,185
down to the origin.

69
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,480
So the vector that
goes from a, B,

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,940
C to XYZ is the

71
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,660
same as the vector
that goes from 0002,

72
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,655
x minus a, y minus b,

73
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,610
z minus c. It's best to

74
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,930
think about factors

75
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,760
not as having coordinates,

76
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,710
but each number that's

77
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,000
separated by commas here

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,450
just tells you the
value in the x,

79
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,160
y, and z directions
respectively.

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,350
So here's an example.

81
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,400
Find the component form of

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,790
the vector

83
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,530
whose initial point
is negative three,

84
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,880
negative two, negative one,

85
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,350
and whose terminal point is

86
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,065
negative one to four.

87
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,240
So if we graph the vector

88
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,550
here in
three-dimensional space,

89
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,965
we can just write

90
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:18,740
the terminal points
negative one to four,

91
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,170
and then subtract
the initial points.

92
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,645
And that gives a
simple calculation.

93
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:26,910
And it turns out to
be the vector 245

94
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,070
A great thing about vectors

95
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,435
is we can scale them,

96
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:33,280
meaning that we
can add them

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,170
together geometrically,

98
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,330
that Beans stringing
the arrows are chaining

99
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,740
them together and to

100
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,105
seeing where they add up.

101
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,445
So we can see, ie,

102
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:42,760
the vector u plus

103
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,755
the vector v ends
up over here.

104
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,320
And we call that
total vector u plus

105
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,880
v. And that turns

106
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,220
out to be the
same as v plus u.

107
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,994
This is actually a
property of vectors.

108
00:03:53,994 --> 00:03:56,605
>> Addition takes
place by just

109
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,854
adding up each component.

110
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:00,310
>> So that's very
convenient. So if you have

111
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,990
the vector with
three components,

112
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,570
U1, U2, U3, and V1, V2, V3.

113
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,130
You just add them
together by adding

114
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,450
each component and then

115
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,300
scaling a vector
is very similar.

116
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,765
When you multiply a
vector times a number,

117
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:13,100
that number just gets

118
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,080
multiplied on each part.

119
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,050
Not the geometric
interpretation of scaling.

120
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,955
So if you multiply
a vector times two,

121
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,634
that actually
doubles the length.

122
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:22,730
>> And that means
the length of

123
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,890
each component is
twice the size.

124
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,500
>> Here's

125
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,405
some important
properties of vectors.

126
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,280
Just keep in mind, when

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,330
you add vectors together,

128
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,950
you can add them
in any order.

129
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,930
They have the
associative property,

130
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,580
just like real numbers do.

131
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,320
There's a special vector,

132
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,580
sort of the arrow,

133
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,115
the invisible arrow
that's size 0.

134
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,480
And you can add it to

135
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,580
any vector and you just
get the vector back.

136
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,815
When you scale vectors,

137
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,060
you have the nice property

138
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,755
where you can just
multiply times,

139
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:55,069
multiply first or
scale one at a time.

140
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,810
>> You can
distribute scalars

141
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,874
across two vectors.

142
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:59,390
>> You can add two scalars

143
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,700
together in a distributed
across the vector.

144
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,620
As we would normally think,

145
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,570
the scalar 0 times

146
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,700
any vector is the 0 vector.

147
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,740
And the magnitude of

148
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,510
a vector behaves this way.

149
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,580
When you scale it,
you can just pull out

150
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,450
the absolute value of

151
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,189
the scalar and you'll
get the same thing.

152
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:16,820
>> And then

153
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,350
the last property is
pretty important.

154
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,790
>> It says that the
only vector that has

155
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,835
length 0 is the
0 vector itself.

156
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:26,465
A special kind of vector
is the unit vector.

157
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:29,555
Unit vector is a
vector of length one.

158
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:31,955
Given any vector v,

159
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,355
you can always find the
unit vector by just

160
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,935
multiplying times
one over the length.

161
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,360
This just takes
the length of

162
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,285
the vector and scales
it to have length one.

163
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:44,465
Once you've scaled
vectors have length one,

164
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,920
then you can ask if

165
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,420
they're pointing in
the same direction.

166
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,795
So any two vectors
are parallel,

167
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:52,264
if they're pointing in
the same direction.

168
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:53,795
>> And you can check
if they're parallel,

169
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,745
is if you scale
them to length one,

170
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:57,155
then say if they
are the same,

171
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:57,560
if they have

172
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,704
the same unit vector
or the opposite.

173
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,530
>> So parallel is

174
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,550
pointing in the
same direction

175
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,660
or opposite directions.

176
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,530
An important thing
about unit vectors

177
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,480
in two dimensions is

178
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,980
every unit vector is

179
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,630
identified with

180
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,790
a specific point on
the unit circle.

181
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,470
So that's a good
way to think about

182
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,910
the direction of vectors

183
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,065
in two dimensional space

184
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:20,180
is at every point
on the unit circle

185
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,970
is actually the
direction of a vector.

186
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,235
So that means in
component form,

187
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,930
we can write unit vectors

188
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,940
just like we
would in Trig as

189
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,920
the cosine of
the angle comma

190
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,635
the sine of the
angle in threes,

191
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:34,430
in three-dimensions,

192
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,230
the situation's a little
more complicated.

193
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,210
You have the angle with

194
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,084
the positive x axis

195
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:41,390
and then you have
the angle with

196
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,130
the positive z axis.

197
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,565
So you can write
the component form

198
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:47,480
of a unit vector in

199
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,550
three dimensions like this.

200
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,900
And every, every

201
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,045
direction in
three-dimensional space,

202
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,650
every unit vectors
associated

203
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,389
with a point on
the unit sphere.

204
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,010
>> And later on in
the class we'll,

205
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,015
we'll call these
coordinates

206
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:01,140
spherical coordinates.

207
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,010
>> There's a couple
important vectors

208
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,630
to be aware of.

209
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,590
I and j are the
unit normal vectors

210
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,940
are standard nor stand at

211
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,220
unit vectors in two
dimensional space.

212
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,170
And they're just the
vectors that 0.1

213
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,400
in the x-direction for i,

214
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,260
in one in the
y-direction for j,

215
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,344
and the same in R3.

216
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:22,804
>> We have the
vectors i, j, and k.

217
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,920
>> These are really
popular vectors

218
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
and they're used to

219
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,710
describe any kind of
direction in the,

220
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,695
the normal standard
unit directions,

221
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:34,760
one in the x direction,

222
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,960
one in the y direction,

223
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,010
and one in the z direction.

224
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,730
So we can always write

225
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,469
factors in these
two different ways.

226
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,345
>> We have the
component form,

227
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,500
which we just learned as

228
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,850
three comma four
comma five.

229
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,800
>> So lets just the
vector that points

230
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,210
three in the x direction

231
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,380
and four in the
y direction,

232
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,610
and five in the
z direction.

233
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,824
>> But we can pull
out those scalars.

234
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,310
>> And what we have
kind of behind

235
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,115
the scenes are these
standard unit vectors.

236
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,830
That means that we
can write the vector

237
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,790
345 is just 3i
plus 4j plus 5K.
