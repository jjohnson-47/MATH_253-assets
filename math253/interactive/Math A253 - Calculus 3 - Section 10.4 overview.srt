1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,745
Let's take a look at
the cross product.

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,340
This is an overview
of section 10.4.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,710
The cross-product
is an operation

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,090
between two vectors

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,770
in three-dimensional space.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,495
You should note
that we can't

7
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:13,530
take the cross product of

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,000
two vectors in
two dimensional

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,175
space that doesn't exist.

10
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,770
So the way that you find
the cross product of

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,820
two vectors is with

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,175
this somewhat complicated
formula here.

13
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,660
So one way to find the

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,770
cross product is just to

15
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,450
memorize this formula or

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,920
put it into a computer.

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,990
But there is actually
a handy procedure

18
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,625
for calculating
the cross-product

19
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,380
that involves the
same procedure as

20
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,835
finding the determinant
of a matrix.

21
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,600
So let's take
a short detour

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,074
into matrices and
determinants.

23
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,250
>> A matrix is just an,

24
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,725
a rectangular
array of values,

25
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,374
a rectangular
array of numbers.

26
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:51,035
>> And the determinant
of a matrix is a way

27
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,805
of kind of measuring how

28
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:55,700
large the matrix
size in some way.

29
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,950
Now, in order to
take the determinant

30
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,570
of a three-by-three matrix,

31
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,800
we need to know
how to take the

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,165
determinant a two by two.

33
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,460
And the determinant
of a 2-by-2 matrix

34
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,600
is you multiply across

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,310
the diagonal AD and then

36
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,995
subtract the
off-diagonal BC.

37
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:11,920
Now for the determinant

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,805
of a three-by-three matrix,

39
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:15,739
the way that the
book describes

40
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,720
is this diagonal trick,

41
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,190
which is nice and
it works great

42
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,764
for three by
three matrices.

43
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,250
>> But what I'm
showing you here is

44
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,890
the method for
co-factor expansion,

45
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,585
which is actually a way to

46
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,579
calculate determinants
of any size.

47
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,970
>> Add some more relatable
to linear algebra.

48
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,200
Now that determined

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,355
the three by three matrix,

50
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,300
you typically do this.

51
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,285
You pick a row or a
column to expand across.

52
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:41,509
In this case, we're
going to go a, B, and C.

53
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,655
>> So first we
start with a,

54
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:45,724
and we see that a is here.

55
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,225
>> And we cross out the row

56
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,370
and the column where a is,

57
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,990
and then the numbers that

58
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,460
are left in the matrix,

59
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,425
we take the
determinant of that.

60
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,090
So we take a times

61
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,855
the determinant of the
sub-matrix E F H I.

62
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:01,610
Now we go over to B and we

63
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,485
alternate sign,
so it's minus.

64
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:04,760
We cross out the row and

65
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
the column where there's B.

66
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,980
And then we take

67
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,165
the determinant
of the matrix.

68
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,200
That's laughed
when we cross

69
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,794
those out, df, GI.

70
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:13,504
>> And then finally C.

71
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:14,990
>> Cross out the
row and column and

72
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,770
take the determinant of

73
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,060
the matrix that's left.

74
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,760
Then finally, we just
have the numbers a, b,

75
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,840
and c multiplied times

76
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,564
determiner of
2-by-2 matrices,

77
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:24,440
which we can find that
the formula above.

78
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,180
And that's how we can get

79
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,355
the determinant of a
three-by-three matrix.

80
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,079
It seems very complicated,

81
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,580
but you just
hold off and see

82
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,100
how much easier it is
once we have numbers.

83
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,575
So here's an example here.

84
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:37,160
Here we're going to take

85
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,660
the determinant of a
three-by-three matrix.

86
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,080
Two, negative 3120,
negative 11 for five.

87
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,350
So we start with the
matrix and we want to do

88
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,640
co-factor expansion
along the

89
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,280
top two, negative 31.

90
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,780
So you cross
out the row and

91
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,100
column with the
two and we see

92
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,890
of the following matrix 0,

93
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,210
negative 14 or five,

94
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,170
same with their negative

95
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,980
three and the same
with the one.

96
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,275
And we alternate signs.

97
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,730
So it's a positive two,

98
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,374
it's a minus negative
three and plus one.

99
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:11,254
>> And then here
we keep the two.

100
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,445
>> And the negative
three and the one

101
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:14,750
here I combined minus

102
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,190
negative three
is plus three.

103
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,480
And then we take
the determinant

104
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,665
of this 2-by-2 matrix,

105
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,630
0 times five
minus four times

106
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,655
negative one and so on.

107
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,950
So at this point, we are
just multiplying and

108
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,330
subtracting numbers

109
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,340
and we get our value of 49.

110
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,785
So the determinant of
this matrix is 49.

111
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,870
So now we will
learn to do is

112
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,150
find the cross product
of two vectors.

113
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,130
So as advertised,

114
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,630
the cross product
of two vectors is

115
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,600
found with this
determinant formula.

116
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,240
So what you do is you
put the vectors i,

117
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,920
j, and k on the top.

118
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,740
And then you put
your first vector u,

119
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,885
its coordinates
along the first row,

120
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:53,285
the second row, and then
the, the third row.

121
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,550
And so once you
have this matrix,

122
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,900
we want to take the
determinant with

123
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,990
this same method that
we already did, i, j,

124
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,400
and k. So we
expand it along

125
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,980
the top I times
the determinant of

126
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,590
the 2-by-2 sub-matrix
and then minus

127
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,450
j times the determinant

128
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,595
of its sub matrix
and so on.

129
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:13,610
And what you end
up getting is

130
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,230
four i minus 11 j

131
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,330
plus eight k. And we

132
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,700
can write that in our
bracket form like this.

133
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,030
So the cross product
of the vectors 20,

134
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,089
negative 1145 is the
vector for negative 118.

135
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,170
>> Ok?

136
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,840
>> So since this is a
technical procedure,

137
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,580
numbers are happen
to be nice here.

138
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,270
>> We were able to

139
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,889
calculate it fairly easily.

140
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,420
>> What if the
numbers are not nice?

141
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,130
Or you need to calculate
a whole bunch of

142
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,060
cross-products and you want

143
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,410
to use a computer.

144
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,660
>> So what I have here

145
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,150
is a Jupyter Notebooks,

146
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,620
which is a web-based way

147
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,824
of using Python code.

148
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:57,050
>> And I have several
examples of this,

149
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,535
and I'll be using
a throw the class,

150
00:04:58,535 --> 00:04:59,600
so please feel free

151
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,010
to ask questions about it.

152
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,290
So if we want to find
the cross product with

153
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,825
Python and the
package Numpy.

154
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:06,980
You can, you can run

155
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,645
a piece of code like this.

156
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,435
We import the
NumPy package.

157
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:14,150
The vector u, I'm
putting in as to 0,

158
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,240
negative one, the vector V,

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,890
and putting in as 145.

160
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,180
And then we can simply run

161
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,985
the cross method
on the bag.

162
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,530
And the vectors u and v to

163
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,299
find with W is printed out.

164
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,040
>> And we see
that for negative

165
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,274
118 is the answer.

166
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:30,430
>> The nice thing
about this is

167
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,990
that no matter what
the numbers are,

168
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,700
you can just put
them in here.

169
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,320
Hit Enter, bam,
and then you

170
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,820
have your crossbar quickly.

171
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,890
And there's all,
you can do many,

172
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,095
many things with
this software

173
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,000
and it's good if you,

174
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,515
even if you're
not using this,

175
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,090
it's good to have some kind

176
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,480
of computer software that

177
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,770
you're using to help

178
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,120
you with the calculations

179
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
after you've done
it by hand to

180
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
verify that they're correct

181
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
and to sort of learn
how to do this

182
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,520
because eventually
you'll be

183
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,020
using some kind of

184
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,390
calculator
calculating software.

185
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,580
If you're gonna do
mass calculations

186
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,390
like cross product or

187
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,590
dot product and
things like that.

188
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,420
>> Okay, so what are the

189
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,979
properties of the
cross product?

190
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,645
>> Here we have,

191
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,520
we see that the
cross-product of

192
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,830
u cross v is not the
same as E cross you.

193
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,600
It's actually the
negative of it.

194
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,670
This is called antique
communitivity.

195
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,170
And it's just
important to remember

196
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,940
that cross-product

197
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,470
isn't like multiplication
in the sense

198
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,135
that two times three
is three times two.

199
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,605
It's actually you get

200
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,795
the negative when
you flip them.

201
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,105
The distributive
property works

202
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,664
like we usually would.

203
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,940
>> The, you can pull in

204
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,810
scalars to either vector.

205
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,230
Number four is saying

206
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,189
something quite important.

207
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:43,540
>> That when you
take the cross

208
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,220
product with a vector is

209
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,879
always orthogonal to
any of the vectors.

210
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,610
>> So the cross
product of u and v is

211
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,810
orthogonal to u because

212
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,969
the dot product of that
vector with you is 0.

213
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,080
>> The cross product of u

214
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,070
and v is orthogonal to

215
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,370
V because the dot
product with v is 0.

216
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,810
The cross product of

217
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,220
a vector with itself is 0,

218
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,110
the cross-product
with the 00.

219
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,030
And then number seven

220
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,660
is something called

221
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,980
the triple scalar product,

222
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,090
which we'll see
in another slide.

223
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,950
>> So here we have
the cross-product and

224
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,904
its relationship
to the angle.

225
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,140
>> And this
formula here says

226
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,470
that the magnitude of
the cross-product,

227
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,460
we can find that by
taking the magnitude of

228
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,854
the two vectors themselves

229
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:29,404
times the sine of the
angle between them.

230
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:32,960
>> And this picture
here shows two vectors,

231
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,144
u and v, and the angle
between them is theta.

232
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,020
>> And we can use
trigonometry to

233
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,165
see that the height of
this parallelogram,

234
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,680
actually the magnitude of

235
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,555
u times the sine of theta.

236
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:46,340
We can find the areas.

237
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,165
Since we have the height

238
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:48,185
and we have the base,

239
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,220
we can find the area

240
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,690
of this parallelogram and

241
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,740
it actually turns out to be

242
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,390
the magnitude of
the cross-product.

243
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,730
So this is a really
important idea,

244
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,890
is that the magnitude
of the cross product is

245
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,885
the area of the
parallelogram

246
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,700
formed by the two vectors.

247
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,210
So anytime you're trying
to find area of, of,

248
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,490
let's say a parallelogram
or a triangle,

249
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,080
which is half of
a parallelogram

250
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,970
in you can use the
cross-product.

251
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,560
There's something called
the right hand rule,

252
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,255
which talks about
the direction

253
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,365
of the cross product.

254
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,910
In the previous
slide, we are talking

255
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,054
about the magnitude
of the cross-product.

256
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,644
>> What about
its direction?

257
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,370
>> So what you do,

258
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,660
the right hand
rule says that

259
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,920
if you take your hand or

260
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
your right hand and you

261
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,220
pointed in the direction
of the first vector,

262
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,750
and then you move it to

263
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,430
the direction of
the second factor.

264
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,750
The cross-product is in

265
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,015
the direction that your
thumb is pointing.

266
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,010
And we can see that if

267
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,810
you do that with
this picture,

268
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,240
that your thumb
should be pointing in

269
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,330
a direction orthogonal
to both u and

270
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,010
v. So here is

271
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,510
an important example using

272
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,415
the cross product
to find an area.

273
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:57,500
So you're giving a triangle

274
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,360
in space like this,

275
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,310
and we'll put points on

276
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,440
them so you can
find the points.

277
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,735
Now if we're going to use

278
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,670
the idea of the
cross product,

279
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,400
which would be to find
the parallelogram

280
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,450
formed by the sides of

281
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,265
these two sides
of the triangle.

282
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:14,300
And then just take half of

283
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,860
that to find the area,

284
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,790
we need to have

285
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,080
it in three-dimensional
space.

286
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,560
Because remember,

287
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,790
the cross-product
is something you

288
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,270
can only do with

289
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,995
vectors in
three-dimensional space.

290
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,480
So you can just do is

291
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,180
imagine the triangle
and this example

292
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,890
sitting in three-dimensional
space with

293
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,059
the z-axis with z
values being 0.

294
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:32,840
>> Okay?

295
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,070
>> So that's just the
same thing as adding

296
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,840
zeros to the end of
the coordinates.

297
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,029
>> Then we can find the
vectors a b and a c.

298
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,010
>> So a b would be

299
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,530
the vector that
goes from a to b.

300
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,420
A c would be the
vector from a to

301
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,290
C. And then we find
those two vectors,

302
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,605
and 1-1-0 and
two negative 10,

303
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,630
we can find the
cross product

304
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,590
of those two vectors.

305
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,670
And we see that
turns out to be

306
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,275
00 and negative three,

307
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,150
which is actually
not surprising

308
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,755
because since the vector

309
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:07,090
AB and AC both lie
in the xy plane,

310
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,040
parallel to the xy plane.

311
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,450
We know that the
cross-product is

312
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,950
going to be
orthogonal to that.

313
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,360
So it points actually

314
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,340
purely in the z direction,

315
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,785
in this case in the
negative z direction.

316
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,110
So then the magnitude of

317
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,610
the cross-product is
just the magnitude

318
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,840
of this vector 00,

319
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,505
negative three,
which is three.

320
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:27,220
And then we remember
that the magnitude of

321
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,260
this cross product
is the area of

322
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,685
the parallelogram formed
these two vectors,

323
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:34,459
which is just two copies
of this triangle.

324
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,320
>> And so the area
of the triangle is

325
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
just three has ok,

326
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,930
so the a parallel pipe,

327
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,760
it, a parallel pipe,

328
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,275
it is a
three-dimensional shape

329
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,059
that's formed by
three vectors.

330
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,680
>> And it's really
just like a box

331
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,465
that's been squished
a little bit.

332
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,300
And there's a really
convenient way to find

333
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,380
the volume of

334
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,660
such a shape with
cross products.

335
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,340
And that involves
this thing called

336
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,095
the triple scalar product.

337
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,120
So if you take any one of

338
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,190
these three vectors and

339
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,600
then take the dot product

340
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,124
with the cross product
of the other two.

341
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:13,774
>> What that gives is
the volume of that box.

342
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:14,930
>> And that actually

343
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,390
has important
consequences for

344
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,140
finding the
distance between

345
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,680
two lines in

346
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,450
three-dimensional
space and so on.

347
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,920
So this is an
important idea,

348
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,779
the triple scalar product.

349
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,370
>> Another application is

350
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,840
torque from physics,

351
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,760
torque is roughly a measure

352
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,529
of turning force
applied to an object.

353
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,390
>> So you, we have
a force vector

354
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,410
F and then we have

355
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,614
some kind of
lever vector l.

356
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,410
>> Okay?

357
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,790
>> And so the force is

358
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,260
what you get, I'm sorry,

359
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,970
the torque is what
we get when we take

360
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,410
the cross product of

361
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,900
the force with the lever.

362
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,360
Now if we think about

363
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,760
the equations
that we just had

364
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,580
in the previous slides,

365
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,905
the cross product has

366
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:01,790
the most magnitude when

367
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,530
the angle is 90 degrees,

368
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,260
because the sine of
90 degrees is one.

369
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,585
So that means that
the parallelogram

370
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,310
is really a rectangle.

371
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,730
So you're going to have
the most torque when

372
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,290
the force is applied

373
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,240
perpendicular to the lever,

374
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,790
which actually
aligns with what we

375
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,230
would normally think as

376
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,459
having the mouse torque.

377
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,780
>> So this is
the formula that

378
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,040
we use in physics
for torque.

379
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,065
>> And usually we take
the magnitude of this

380
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:31,710
defined how large
the torque is
