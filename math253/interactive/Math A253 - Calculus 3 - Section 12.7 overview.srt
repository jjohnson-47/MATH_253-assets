1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Let's look at a quick
overview of section

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,530
12.7 on tangent lines,

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,180
normal lines, and
tangent planes.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,900
>> If we have

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,430
a curve in
three-dimensional space,

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,510
which is the graph of

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,534
a function of
two variables.

8
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:17,280
>> We can talk about
the tangent lines,

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,180
but there's tangent lines

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,200
in different directions.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,160
You can have a tangent line

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,180
to the x direction,

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,680
y direction, and you can

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,999
add the tangent line
in any direction.

15
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,420
>> We've already talked

16
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,920
about the directional
derivative,

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,420
which tells us how
much the function is

18
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,654
changing in the
z direction.

19
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:33,170
>> And so for

20
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,840
the line, all we
need is a point.

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,480
And if we look at
numbers 123 year,

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,400
it's talking about the line

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,960
in the x direction,
y direction,

24
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,970
in any direction you,

25
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,474
but the point is the same.

26
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,560
>> X-naught,
y-naught, z naught,

27
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,270
which is what we get
when we put x nought,

28
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,859
y nought into the function.

29
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,275
>> And the
direction vector,

30
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,435
if we take a look
at the x direction,

31
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:59,764
is one step in the x
direction, one comma 0.

32
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,460
>> And then how,
how much do we

33
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,290
increase in the, in
the z direction?

34
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,410
Well,

35
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,345
that's the derivative
with respect to x,

36
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:08,405
similar in the y
direction, 0 comma one.

37
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:09,950
Then how much do
we increase in

38
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,080
the function with respect
to the y direction,

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,909
the derivative f
with respect to y.

40
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,380
>> And then similarly

41
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,330
in arbitrary direction U1,

42
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,100
U2 demanded,

43
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,360
demanded, the
function increases

44
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,979
the directional derivative.

45
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,170
>> So this is the
same equations

46
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,060
for lines that we
saw in chapter ten,

47
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,440
where we have a
point on the line

48
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,565
in a direction vector.

49
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:29,930
Except now the direction
vector is being

50
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,340
described in terms
of the derivative.

51
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,850
>> Here's an example to

52
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,170
find the tangent line.

53
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,370
>> So the surface of

54
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,454
this function
sine x cosine y.

55
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:42,169
>> And here it three
different directions.

56
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:42,860
>> The direction of x

57
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,225
drafted in direction of y,

58
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:46,999
and this direction,
negative 11.

59
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,385
>> We can remember that the

60
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:51,140
directional
derivative is defined

61
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,220
in terms of the
dot product of the

62
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,485
gradient with
the direction.

63
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:56,075
Here we're focusing
at the point

64
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,684
pi over two, pi over two.

65
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:02,450
>> And the x-direction
is an i, the i vector,

66
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,055
y directions, the j vector,

67
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:06,574
and the direction
of negative 11.

68
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:07,370
>> We have to scale it

69
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,390
by its magnitude to make

70
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,180
sure as length one
is the following.

71
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,770
To find the gradient,

72
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,359
we take the partial
derivatives

73
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:16,594
put in the point pi
over two, pi over two.

74
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,350
>> And here we just get 0

75
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,190
is the partial with

76
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,360
respect to x and
negative ones,

77
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,594
partial derivatives to y.

78
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:27,200
>> So in the x
direction we have

79
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,420
a point pi over

80
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,975
two comma pi over
two comma 0.

81
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,390
And then we have the
direction vector,

82
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,804
in this case, one comma 0.

83
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,520
>> And then the z
direction is 0.

84
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,579
So the equation of the
line is the following.

85
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,300
>> In the y direction, we

86
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,710
have our point
on the line Pi

87
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,480
over two comma pi
over two comma 0.

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,650
And the direction
vector here is

89
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,090
01, negative one.

90
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,265
And now with respect to
the other direction,

91
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,180
again,

92
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,935
wherever point and
wherever direction vector.

93
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:01,430
In our case,

94
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,750
the direction vector
is negative one over

95
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,670
root 21 over root two,

96
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,110
and then negative
one over root two.

97
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,350
Normal lines, normal lines

98
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,490
have been with
us all along,

99
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,870
we just haven't
looked at them that

100
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,745
closely and calculus one,

101
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,110
but we pay a lot
of attention

102
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,224
to the tangent line.

103
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:22,370
>> And in physics,

104
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,080
the normal lines are
important because it's

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,125
the direction of the
force opposite of,

106
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,225
of the, of the velocity,

107
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:32,400
or, I'm sorry, the
acceleration. On the graph

108
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,415
>> So if we have a
function of two variables

109
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:41,619
in a graph in
three-dimensional space,

110
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,240
what we can do is look at

111
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,655
the vectors that are
tangent to the plane,

112
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:48,324
which we've already seen
in previous slides.

113
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:49,900
>> So the direction,

114
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,970
the x direction and y
direction vectors are

115
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,074
given with these
two factors.

116
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,740
>> And to find a
normal vector,

117
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,104
we can take the
cross-product.

118
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,500
>> If we take the
cross-product to

119
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,390
actually get a
nice formula here.

120
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,060
It's the derivative with

121
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,964
respect to x, with
respect to y.

122
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:08,919
>> Come on one, these
two are negative.

123
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,760
>> Just for the sake of

124
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
having a nice formula,

125
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,100
usually take the
normal vector to

126
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,690
be the opposite direction,

127
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,570
which is still normal
to the tangent plane.

128
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,310
And we get a
nice formula for

129
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,120
the normal vector on

130
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,204
the surface of a function
of two variables.

131
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,960
>> It's sort of like
the gradient with

132
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,550
a negative one
attached at the end.

133
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,200
>> Now here's a problem
where we want to find

134
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,755
the distance from a
point to the surface.

135
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,050
So if you have a point q

136
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,430
sitting out in
space somewhere,

137
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,810
and we have a surface,
in this case,

138
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,729
two minus x squared,
minus y squared.

139
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,204
>> How can we find
that distance?

140
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,460
>> The mathematical
setup is to

141
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,560
find the any point on
the surface, call it P,

142
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,790
whose When you take

143
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,620
the vector PQ is

144
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,780
parallel to the
normal vector,

145
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,960
that will be the point
in which it will have

146
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,250
the shortest
distance. Okay?

147
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,960
>> So that's the
mathematical said we'll take

148
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,700
an arbitrary point P

149
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,964
at x-naught,
y-naught, z naught.

150
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,040
>> And find the vector
p to q and then

151
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
impose that that's parallel

152
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,190
to the normal vector.

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,145
So if we take our
point p here,

154
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:24,175
we, then we find
that the vector PQ,

155
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:26,380
we just take 2.2.2

156
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,955
and subtract the components

157
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:31,450
of P, The normal vector.

158
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,695
>> We use the formula

159
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:34,030
from the previous slide,

160
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,240
the partial derivatives
with respect to x,

161
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,550
y, and then negative
one at the end.

162
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,980
And then we impose that
these two vectors are

163
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,240
parallel because
that's where

164
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,670
the shortest
distance occurs.

165
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,744
And that gives us
three equations.

166
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,890
>> We can solve
for c in each of

167
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,150
these equations
and then set the

168
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,280
following equal
to each other.

169
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,514
And that gives us
the following.

170
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:56,150
>> Now, the first equation

171
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,725
here between x-naught
and why not?

172
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,725
You'll notice that
they are the same.

173
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,840
So this, this first
equation means that

174
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
x nought and y nought are

175
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,180
actually equal
to each other.

176
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,960
So if x dot is
equal to y naught,

177
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,550
then we can use
the other equation

178
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,415
defined what x-naught
might, might be.

179
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,530
So we want to solve for x

180
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,004
naught in the
following equation.

181
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,940
>> Now if we do some
rearranging here,

182
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,889
we get this cubic equation.

183
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,210
>> Four x cubed

184
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,980
plus x naught minus
two equals 0.

185
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,500
This is actually a
challenging equation

186
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,820
to find an exact answer.

187
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,320
It's not impossible,
but you can see you

188
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,420
some fun algebra to see

189
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,415
that you can get
the answer here.

190
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:35,720
Usually what we do in this

191
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,220
situation to
find the answer

192
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,510
is just a graph it and

193
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,475
find where it
crosses the x axis.

194
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:45,274
And in this case we
get about 0.68940.

195
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,430
>> Ok?

196
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,620
>> So that means we
find an x value,

197
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,180
our y-value, we
stick it into

198
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,890
the function to
find the z value.

199
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,690
And now we found a point on

200
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,550
the surface where it

201
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,500
has the shortest
distance to the point Q.

202
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:04,070
>> The actual distance
is the magnitude of

203
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,190
that vector from this
point P to the point Q.

204
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,800
The tangent plane is

205
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,910
actually been
lingering in the

206
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,200
background along.

207
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,060
We've had these
direction vectors

208
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,355
that are parallel to
the tangent plane.

209
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,615
And now we have a normal
vector at any point.

210
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:23,860
So a plane is

211
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,484
a point together with
the normal vector.

212
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,510
>> So a normal
vector is going to

213
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,090
be the partial derivative X

214
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,890
than Y negative one.

215
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,360
And those are
the coefficients

216
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,394
in front of each term.

217
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,645
>> And then the point
x nought, y nought,

218
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,560
and z nought,

219
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,804
the gradient.

220
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:50,775
>> You can find
the gradient of

221
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,015
a function of
three variables

222
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,650
in the same way.

223
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,660
And we can use
the fact that

224
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,820
the gradient vector is

225
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,879
always orthogonal to
the level curves.

226
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,784
>> This is actually
a very useful fact.

227
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,400
>> So if we have

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,260
a function of
three variables,

229
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,655
we can use the fact that

230
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,690
when we find the gradient,

231
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,250
it's orthogonal to
the level curves.

232
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,445
>> So here's an example.

233
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,335
Let's find the
normal vectors

234
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,180
on the surface of
this function.

235
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,260
And this is the
same function we

236
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,550
used in the
previous examples.

237
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,859
We can use the previous
theorem to realize

238
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,780
this function is actually

239
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,920
a level curve of

240
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,569
a function of one
more variable.

241
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:33,020
>> So if we let z
be f of x comma y,

242
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,629
and then move x0
to the other side.

243
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,494
>> Now we can see
that this surface

244
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,010
described by z equal to

245
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,900
two minus x squared minus
y squared is really

246
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,200
just this three-dimensional
function of x,

247
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,029
y, and z equal to 0.

248
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,219
>> So it's a level curve.

249
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,320
>> So defined
a level curve,

250
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,150
the vector that's
orthogonal

251
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,529
or normal to a level curve.

252
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,700
>> We take the gradient of

253
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,695
this three
variable function

254
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,260
and we can see that
we get negative 2x,

255
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,520
negative two, negative one,

256
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,780
which is exactly
what we got

257
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,540
before finding
the gradient by

258
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,775
using the normal vector

259
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,770
or the cross product
the other way.
