00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,454
Hi, class.

2
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:02,040
>> Let's take a look at

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,000
an overview of Section

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,660
13.1 on iterated
integrals and area.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,520
This is the introduction of

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,710
integrals of functions
of more than one.

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,759
>> Brave to motivate
what's going on here.

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,040
>> If we have a function f

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,960
of x and y and its

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,269
partial derivative
with respect to X.

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,864
>> How do we get the
function f back?

12
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,680
>> Well, in calculus one,

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,550
if we were just
talking about

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,720
a function of a
single variable,

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,875
you would take its

16
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,920
antiderivative and
you would have

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,570
the function f back plus

18
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,510
some constant
integration here.

19
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,530
We can integrate

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,700
the derivative
with respect to

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,585
x, with respect to x.

22
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,190
And then we do
get the function

23
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,470
back plus some
constant integration.

24
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,880
But since we
integrated with

25
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,260
respect to x here,

26
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,685
the constant of integration

27
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,905
might be any function of y.

28
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:54,950
And that makes sense
if we were to look at

29
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,300
both sides of this
equation here and

30
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,355
take the derivative
with respect to x.

31
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:00,170
If we take the
derivative respect to

32
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,170
x of the right
hand side here,

33
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,120
we get the derivative
of f with respect to x.

34
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,520
And then the
derivative respect

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,380
to x of a function of
y would just be 0.

36
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,870
So let's integrate the
following function.

37
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,000
Since we're integrating
with respect to x,

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,055
the limits of integration

39
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:21,485
can be with respect to
any other variable.

40
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,880
So you find the

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,950
anti-derivative
with respect to x,

42
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,525
thinking of y
as a constant,

43
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,295
and apply the
fundamental theorem of

44
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,350
calculus as we usually
would put again,

45
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,820
the values of
two i and one is

46
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,750
the limits of integration,

47
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,650
taking the difference.

48
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,470
Now this is another common

49
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,760
situation where
we're trying to

50
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,480
find the integral of a
function of x and y,

51
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,490
first with respect
to y, then

52
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,305
with respect to x.

53
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:51,270
This is called an
iterated integral.

54
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Sometimes it's
understood that you're

55
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,250
taking and take the
derivative with

56
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,735
respect to y first,

57
00:01:56,735 --> 00:02:00,035
Thus the d y appearing
before the dx.

58
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:02,700
And will you just
drop the parentheses?

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,125
So we would just do this
one step at a time.

60
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,390
So working on the
inside integral,

61
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,339
you would take the
antiderivative

62
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,860
of this time with
respect to y and

63
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,970
evaluate at the limits of

64
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,200
integration here at X

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
and X and one and take

66
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,455
the difference,
simplify a bit.

67
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:19,400
And then what you have

68
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,450
is just a function of x,

69
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,890
and that's just a normal

70
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,240
Calc Two type integral.

71
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,340
>> What does the 89 over

72
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,539
eight even mean though?

73
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,210
>> So we are given this
original expression,

74
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,055
which is a double integral.

75
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:37,189
And we got the answer
which is just a number.

76
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,755
>> So we're going to see

77
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:42,290
that this function
of two variables,

78
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,925
x and y, that we're given

79
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,100
its graph writers in
three-dimensional space.

80
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,199
>> And its graph
is a surface

81
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,459
that is above and
below the XY plane.

82
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,440
>> And the double

83
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,660
integral here is
actually finding

84
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,180
the volume underneath
the graph of

85
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,610
that function
between bounded

86
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,390
between the graph of

87
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,785
the function in
the x, y plane.

88
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:05,030
So that's what this number

89
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,410
89 over eight refers to.

90
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,630
>> So if we were to
sketch the region of

91
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,980
integration for

92
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,290
this example, and
what does that mean?

93
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,410
>> That means finding
the region in

94
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,315
the domain of the function

95
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,460
for which we're
finding the integral.

96
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,100
So here for any fixed x

97
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,445
looking on the
outside between 12.

98
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,130
So for any x between 12,

99
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,720
we are going to
integrate a y from

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,604
one up to y equals to x.

101
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,750
>> So this
particular integral

102
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,160
is integrating over

103
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,014
the region R in
the picture here.

104
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:53,300
>> And it's doing
it by integrating

105
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,350
vertical strips one
acts at a time and

106
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,790
then accumulating all of

107
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,490
those vertical strips
to get the volume.

108
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,250
>> Sometimes once we know

109
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,215
the region on which
we're integrating over,

110
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,460
it's common to write

111
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,185
the two integral signs with

112
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,945
just the region
name underneath it.

113
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:19,115
Now this expression here

114
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,440
is the double integral of

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,090
the function over
that region.

116
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,430
But to actually find
it and calculate it,

117
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,855
we need to write it as an

118
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,789
iterated integral
as it was given.

119
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,070
>> So a lot of
problems start

120
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,480
by providing an integral

121
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,009
that looks like this.

122
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,900
>> And we have

123
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,420
to use the limits
of integration,

124
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,850
find the sort of nature
and character of

125
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,960
the region in order to

126
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,045
write it as an
iterated integral.

127
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:46,310
Here, DA is sort of

128
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,950
referring to
either dx or dy y.

129
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,330
So it's convenient
to be able to,

130
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,580
to integrate functions of

131
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,945
two variables that are

132
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:59,810
bounded by two functions

133
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,189
on the top and the bottom.

134
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,600
>> And we can integrate

135
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,550
them the way that we
would normally want to.

136
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,585
>> One easy application for

137
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:10,100
these double
integrals is just

138
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,374
finding areas in the plane.

139
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:16,165
>> So if we have an area
bounded between the,

140
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,220
this region R here,
but bounded between

141
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,740
these red lines and these
two blue functions.

142
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,770
How could we find
the volume of our,

143
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,810
well, you could do
this in a calculus

144
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,904
to sense, right?

145
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:29,450
>> You could
just accumulate

146
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,280
the area in between.

147
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,300
>> But one, right?

148
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,410
Now we want to
think about it

149
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,210
as this area is

150
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,595
the same thing
as the volume

151
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,669
of this area with
a height of one.

152
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,560
>> And that allows
us to write

153
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,719
it as a double integral.

154
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,890
>> So the volume
of this region is

155
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,060
the area of each of

156
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,670
these vertical strips
between g2 and g1.

157
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,650
>> So this is G2 minus g1.

158
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,570
And we can write it as
this integral here.

159
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,040
So this is a common way of

160
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,690
finding areas in the plane.

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,580
And this is the
contents of theorem

162
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,800
three to 13.1.1
in our text.

163
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,880
>> Another really
common example

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,154
with iterated integrals.

165
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,400
>> And this we'll see

166
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,620
later that many integrals,

167
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,420
perhaps we can't
do it because

168
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,685
the function here has
no anti-derivative.

169
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,980
But if we change
the order of

170
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,594
integration or do a
change of coordinates

171
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,430
>> Maybe the new
function that we end

172
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,544
up with does have
an anti-derivative.

173
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:44,390
>> So changing the
order of integration

174
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,610
given an integral is
a common thing to do,

175
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,820
but the meat of the
matter really has to

176
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,050
do with understanding of

177
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,210
the region that we're
integrating over.

178
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,210
And that allows us to
change the limits of

179
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,800
integration to make sure

180
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,494
that we're integrating
over the same region.

181
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:01,744
>> So let's take a look
at this example here.

182
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,220
>> The first thing to
do is to understand

183
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,950
the region that we're
integrating over here.

184
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,420
We're integrating from y,

185
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,145
going from 0 to four,

186
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,720
but where x goes

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,930
between these two
functions of y,

188
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,300
so this is this
picture here.

189
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,735
So y goes between 04,

190
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,670
x is going to go between

191
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,800
y plus four over two,

192
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,570
which is this line

193
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,740
2x y squared over
four, which is here.

194
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,990
So the region that
we're integrating over

195
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,659
here is this
purple region R.

196
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,475
>> And we're integrating it

197
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:41,750
by accumulating the
horizontal strips, right?

198
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,510
>> For if, for each
y we get region,

199
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,580
we get x going

200
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,935
between these two
functions of y.

201
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,485
And then the
integral accumulates

202
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,330
those horizontal strips.

203
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,135
And then finally,
we accumulate that,

204
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,070
we accumulate those
horizontal strips

205
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,734
by integrating
with respect to y.

206
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:05,959
>> So how do we change
it to be an integral?

207
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,970
>> First with respect to y,

208
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,564
then with respect to X.

209
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:13,265
>> Well now we have to

210
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,320
sort of cut the volume.

211
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,100
>> So the, think about it.

212
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,255
The graph is
relating sitting

213
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:19,955
above this picture
of the region.

214
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,680
So we're really
finding a volume and

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,215
risk finding that
volume by cutting it,

216
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:25,820
by cutting its
cross sections

217
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,350
in a certain,
certain directions.

218
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,730
So now we want to cut

219
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,619
those cross sections
vertically up and down.

220
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,470
>> But if we do that,

221
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,620
we see that our region
are the nature of

222
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,660
its bounds actually changes

223
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,444
here at x equal to two.

224
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,095
>> Because when
x is equal to,

225
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,270
when x is between 02,

226
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,110
we can see the two
functions y equals to

227
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,950
0 and this line here,

228
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,120
which is y equals

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,000
two to x when

230
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,220
you solve for y
in this equation.

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,700
So it's going to bound,

232
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,900
the bounds are
going to be between

233
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,040
y equals 0 and

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,099
y equals two to x in
this first region, R1.

235
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:11,450
>> And then the bounds
are going to be

236
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,800
between here.

237
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,940
>> When you
solve for y, you

238
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,910
get y equals 2x,
2x minus four.

239
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,170
So the bounds
are going to be

240
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,850
between equals to

241
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,245
two root x and y equals

242
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,959
2x minus four
in this region.

243
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,750
>> But it's important
that we see this as

244
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,820
two separate pieces
because the limits

245
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,840
of integration
are going to be

246
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,189
different on
these two pieces.

247
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:32,810
>> So we have to
actually split up the

248
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,760
integral into the sum of

249
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,770
two integrals in order to

250
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,010
write the integral
in terms of dy, dx.

251
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,134
>> Okay?

252
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:47,030
>> So we take the
original integral,

253
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,800
we write it as the sum of

254
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,330
the integrals of
the same function.

255
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,380
We're just integrating
the function

256
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,550
one here because
we're finding

257
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,860
the area over
these two regions.

258
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,704
But over these two regions,

259
00:09:56,704 --> 00:10:00,030
we need to find these
two new boundaries.

260
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,565
And that allows
us to rewrite

261
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,950
the limits of integration.

262
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,355
Now with respect to
the dy by dx integral,

263
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,730
notice how we can't just
swap roles x and y.

264
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,815
That's a very
common mistake.

265
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,735
If these problems, we
can't just switches,

266
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:19,250
switch x and y's and

267
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,480
expect to be integrating

268
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,100
over the exact same region.

269
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,990
We really do have to draw

270
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,400
the region and think about

271
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,660
how the limits of

272
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,530
integration are going

273
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,550
to describe that region.

274
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,640
But now we're given

275
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,230
two iterated
integral separately.

276
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,670
So we can use

277
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,750
our normal techniques of

278
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,490
integration to find
these integrals.
