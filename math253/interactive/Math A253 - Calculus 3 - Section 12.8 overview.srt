1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,150
Let's take a look
at Section 12.8,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,175
which is on extreme values.

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:06,510
Now this slide has

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,815
a lot of information on it,

5
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:11,025
but let's try to
keep it simple.

6
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:15,165
A function has an
absolute maximum, right?

7
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,060
If it's point
x-naught, y-naught,

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,530
if it's bigger than
everywhere else in

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,840
the function has an
absolute minimum.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,460
If it's less than
everywhere else.

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,015
And the function, it's
a relative maximum

12
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:27,680
if it's bigger
than everywhere

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,790
else in some

14
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,320
little neighborhood
of the point.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,180
And similarly for
relative minimum,

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,660
the maximums and

17
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,565
minimums are
called extremis,

18
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:39,140
the point at which

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,900
the partial derivatives
are equal to 0,

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,970
which means those
tangent slopes

21
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,875
of those tangent
lines are 0,

22
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,240
which means the
function is sort

23
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,685
of locally flat
at that point,

24
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,439
are called critical points.

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,900
>> Or if, or if those
derivatives are

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,680
not defined in calculus.

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,410
>> One, if I point,

28
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,180
was a critical point,

29
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,860
if the derivative
was equal to,

30
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,310
the derivative was
equal to u equal to 0.

31
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,530
>> Or if it didn't exist in

32
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,900
calculus 3, x nought,

33
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,210
y nought is a
critical point

34
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,880
if its gradient is
equal to the 0 vector,

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,890
or it's gradient
does not exist.

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,640
Notice that the gradient
of the function has

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,930
really taken the place

38
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,720
of f prime from
calculus one.

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,910
And if we really
think about it,

40
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,535
f prime for a
single variable

41
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,365
really is just a
gradient as well.

42
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:38,840
Just a gradient of
a single dimension.

43
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,935
Let's find the
relative extrema

44
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,615
of a function.

45
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:46,730
So we can find the
partial derivatives,

46
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,755
set them equal to 0,

47
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:53,090
and then solve in
this case we get

48
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,560
the point two-thirds come

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,949
a 1 third and it's
a critical point.

50
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,410
>> Okay, so we found
the critical point

51
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,104
at two-thirds, 1 third.

52
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,680
>> But how do we
know that it's a

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,899
maximum or a
minimum or neither?

54
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,789
>> That's the tricky part.

55
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,419
>> We can just graph
it like I did here.

56
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,610
>> I put in the
value two-thirds,

57
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,349
1 third for x and y.

58
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,820
>> And then you can see

59
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,990
that it's the point on

60
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,260
the bottom of the graph
of the function here.

61
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,310
So it must be a minimum.

62
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,010
In general, you can
find whether or not

63
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,060
a critical point
is a maximum

64
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,440
or minimum by graphing it,

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,180
not always possible,
especially if

66
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,145
it's a function of more
than two variables.

67
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,710
We can use numerical
approximations,

68
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,640
which means just put
end points nearby into

69
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,750
the function and find what

70
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,950
its values are and see if

71
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,300
those values are above

72
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,280
or below your
critical value.

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,420
Or we can use

74
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,835
some more sophisticated
kind of factoring

75
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,230
or analysis to determine
that it's a minimum.

76
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,065
Now if you don't
have technology,

77
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:57,760
usually what we need to do

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,635
is some kind of analysis.

79
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,900
So with this
particular function,

80
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,700
we can notice that
the given function is

81
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,935
actually in the
form of a conic.

82
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,080
And you might recall
from precalculus that

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,280
iconic is an equation
of the following form.

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,250
And when you have a b term,

85
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,530
in our case, negative
one is the B term.

86
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,790
>> It's the, the part in

87
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,754
front of the next x, y.

88
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:23,050
>> That means it's
a rotated conic.

89
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,720
And you may not remember
this from pre calc,

90
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,095
but I'm just kinda
bringing it up as a way to

91
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:31,630
use some skills
from calculus

92
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,885
to determine whether
this might be a minimum.

93
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:38,770
So we identified as
iconic rotated conic.

94
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,300
And then there's this
formula says that

95
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,535
the rotation angle
must be the cotangent

96
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,545
of the difference in

97
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:48,270
a minus c divided
by b. In this case.

98
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,315
In this case,
a's minus C a 0.

99
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,890
The cotangent
theta equals to

100
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,900
0 means theta is
pi over four.

101
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,060
Then we have
rotation equations

102
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,650
where we actually change

103
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,780
the coordinate
system to make

104
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,525
the a conic that doesn't,

105
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,670
no longer has
the mixed term.

106
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,560
And I just went
ahead and did this.

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,125
And I see that if we
make that substitution,

108
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,580
our original function

109
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,380
becomes this new function,

110
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,710
which maybe looks messier
but actually is in

111
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,090
the standard form for any,

112
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,875
for every constant
value of z,

113
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,350
it's in the standard
form of an ellipse.

114
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,910
So the level curves of

115
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,799
our function are ellipses.

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,370
And if we, we

117
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,840
already saw the graph
of the function,

118
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,715
which is, it's our
parabola lloyd.

119
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,650
So a parabola lloyd
Is a function

120
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,080
whose level curves are
ellipses going up and

121
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,430
whose cross sections
with respect to

122
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,960
the axis z and

123
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,290
y-z planes are parabolas,

124
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,525
so therefore it
must be a minimum.

125
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,670
So this is a
way to use some

126
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,240
of our knowledge from

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,385
precalculus to
determine that,

128
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:53,960
to determine if whether

129
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,550
that critical point
is a minimum or not.

130
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,180
>> You can have
points where

131
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,124
the derivatives are both 0.

132
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:04,195
>> So it's, it's locally
flat at the point.

133
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:05,140
But depending on

134
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,670
which direction
you're facing,

135
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,140
it might be at
the bottom of

136
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,180
the well or it might
be at the top of

137
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,070
a hill K. So

138
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,215
that point is called
a saddle point.

139
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,810
Saddle point is defined by

140
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,820
the partial
derivatives exist and

141
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,845
are both 0, so it's flat.

142
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,240
And then in any little disk

143
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,665
around that point,

144
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,000
you can find values of the

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
function which are greater

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
than and you can
find values of

147
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,170
the function that are
less than that point.

148
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,090
So it's not a
maximum or minimum.

149
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,470
We want something like

150
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,895
the second derivative test

151
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,575
for functions of
two variables.

152
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:40,960
We have the second
derivative test, remember,

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,695
tells us something about

154
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:43,555
concavity of the function.

155
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:46,375
If it's concave up at
that critical point,

156
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,010
then we know it's
a minimum, right?

157
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,395
If it's concave down,
then it's a maximum.

158
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:51,895
While the credit,
the credit,

159
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,020
the concavity is determined

160
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,130
by the second derivative.

161
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,870
But with a function
of two variables,

162
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,475
you have many
second derivatives.

163
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:58,930
You have the derivatives
with respect

164
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,370
to x and y,

165
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,860
and y x, y and y ax.

166
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,220
It turns out that if
we were to approximate

167
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,875
our function of
two variables

168
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,600
by a quadratic, sort of.

169
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,120
So I'm like a Multivariable
Taylor series,

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,105
that this value d here,

171
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:19,330
which is the determinant
of a Hessian matrix,

172
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,880
which we don't, you can
feel free to look up.

173
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,890
But this value d is

174
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,130
that coefficient
in front of those.

175
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,010
Quadratic terms. So it's

176
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,320
describing concavity of

177
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,210
a function of two
variables in the same way

178
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,949
that f double-prime

179
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,555
does in a single variable.

180
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:38,375
And we can follow the
following rules here.

181
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,830
If at any point,

182
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,750
if d is positive,

183
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,890
now it's assuming
that we're

184
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,285
looking at a
critical point.

185
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,975
So you find the critical
points who put them.

186
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,375
And if d is positive,

187
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,340
that means it's
a max or a min.

188
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,200
T determines a max or min.

189
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,195
You can use the derivative,

190
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,100
the secondary
with respect to x

191
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,870
to look at its concavity in

192
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,460
the normal sense to

193
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,590
determine if it's a
minimum or positive.

194
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,820
Here at the second
derivative is

195
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,440
positive, then
it's a minimum.

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,580
If the second
derivative is negative,

197
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,260
it's a maximum.

198
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,225
If D is negative,

199
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,145
that means at a
saddle point,

200
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,500
if t is 0, we don't know.

201
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,970
We have to use some
other methods.

202
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,514
>> So here's an example.

203
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,269
>> Liver function.

204
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,410
>> We want to
determine whether it

205
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,430
has a relative maximum,

206
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,360
minimum, or a saddle point

207
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,380
at each of the
critical points.

208
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,880
>> So we can find the
critical points by

209
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,930
finding the gradient and

210
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,235
setting it equal to 0.

211
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,855
That gives us a
couple of equations.

212
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,340
Here we have a
critical point at

213
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,590
one comma two and
negative one comma two.

214
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,800
We can take the second
derivatives and plug

215
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,205
in the 0.1 comma two.

216
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:43,520
Now d is the

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,080
secondary with
respect to x times

218
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,370
the secondary with
respect to y.

219
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,940
So six times one
times negative

220
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,540
two then

221
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,160
minus the mixed partial

222
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,810
derivatives are 0 times 0.

223
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,700
That gives us negative
12, which is negative.

224
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,455
Since d is negative
at that point,

225
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,374
we know that it's
a saddle point.

226
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:04,340
>> Now we try negative
one comma two.

227
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,690
>> So six times
negative one

228
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,790
times negative two,
which is positive 12.

229
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,380
Again, we're
subtracting 0 with

230
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,915
the mixed partials,
so that's positive.

231
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,550
And then when you take
a look at the sign

232
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,870
of the second derivative,

233
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,324
select acts,
that's negative.

234
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:17,390
>> So this must be

235
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,190
a maximum from
calculus one.

236
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,480
>> Remember that
any kind of,

237
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,620
any different

238
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,990
continuous
differential function

239
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,880
on a closed interval,

240
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,400
she does maximum, minimum.

241
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,350
The reason why we spend so

242
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,400
much time talking about

243
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
closed bounded sets earlier

244
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,480
is that the same thing is

245
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,560
true for a function of

246
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,750
two variables defined over

247
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,175
a closed bounded set.

248
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:46,170
It must also have
a maximum minimum.

249
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:50,400
>> So let's take a
look at this example.

250
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:53,045
>> If we have
this function f,

251
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,799
and then we have
this triangular

252
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,900
region in its domain.

253
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,750
In this particular
region is given.

254
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,850
But the vertices negative
one to negative or

255
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,715
negative to 012,
negative two.

256
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,710
We'd like to know what
is the maximum and

257
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,730
the minimum values of

258
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,040
f over this
triangular region?

259
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,840
The strategy is to find

260
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,000
a relative maximum
or minimum on

261
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,640
the inside of the region.

262
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,400
And then we have to break
down the boundaries

263
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,430
individually and find
its relative maximum

264
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,410
or minimums on those.

265
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,570
And then that gives
us candidates

266
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,190
for what the maximum and

267
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,390
minimum of what it might be

268
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,580
over the entire region.

269
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,159
So on the interior,

270
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,170
we take the gradient
and set it equal to

271
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,680
0 and determine what
points that might be.

272
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,210
In this case, 0 comma

273
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,800
0 is the point

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,150
where the gradient
is equal to 0.

275
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,470
So 0 comma 0 is our first

276
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,384
candidate for a max or min.

277
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,300
>> Now we have
to break up the,

278
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,460
the boundary of
that triangle

279
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,529
into its various pieces.

280
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:00,970
>> There's, I
broke it up into

281
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,470
segment a, B, and C here.

282
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,820
So first on segment a,

283
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,100
if we substitute y
equals to negative

284
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,770
two into the
original equation,

285
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,644
into the, into the
original function.

286
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:17,994
>> What we've
done is review.

287
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,060
>> We reduced it to

288
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,695
a function of a
single variable.

289
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,570
Now we can find
its max or mins in

290
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,340
the same way that we
wouldn't calculus one.

291
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,335
In this case, this
is pretty clear.

292
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,945
This is a parabola
shifted up one,

293
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:29,470
so it's going to have

294
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,315
a minimum at x equals to 0.

295
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,670
But notice that this
is a line segment over

296
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,970
a closed interval,
negative one to two.

297
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,420
We also have to consider
the endpoints with

298
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,925
x equal to negative one
and x equal to two.

299
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:42,830
And for segment a, y is

300
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,095
always equal to
negative two.

301
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,330
So we have x equals to 0.

302
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,980
Negative 12 are

303
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,440
possible maximum
admins that gives,

304
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,410
it gives rise to
these three points.

305
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,215
So we're keeping track
of all of the points

306
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:58,130
that are candidates for

307
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,035
maximum ends with
a functions.

308
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:04,325
Now on Segment B, it's
a similar kind of

309
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:07,550
procedure that
the segment is

310
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,170
described with this line y

311
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,195
equals negative three
halves x plus one.

312
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:12,710
What we do is we
substitute that

313
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,210
back into the function for

314
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,785
y that gives us a
function of only x,

315
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:21,065
which is the following
quadratic function.

316
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,340
We can find its maximum

317
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,734
minimums using calculus.

318
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,714
>> Take the derivative,
set it equal to 0.

319
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:27,020
>> Turns out axes six

320
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,050
fifths and y is
negative four-fifths.

321
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,670
So now we have,

322
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,260
and then we have
the endpoints with

323
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,975
x equals to 0 and
x equals two.

324
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,850
And when x is equal to two,

325
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,020
we actually get
the same point

326
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,890
that we got before.

327
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,495
So the new candidates
are the points

328
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,310
0 comma, 1 sixth comma,

329
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,850
negative four-fifths in

330
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,050
segments C, it's done.

331
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,810
>> Similarly, you put y
equal to 3x plus one.

332
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,460
>> And for y,
substitute that in.

333
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,180
For f, take the derivatives

334
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,260
are equal to 0 and we

335
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,460
get the point
negative three,

336
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,230
a negative 1 eighth.

337
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,720
Now, all of the
points that we found,

338
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,875
we found seven of them.

339
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,410
00, negative one,
negative 20,

340
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,735
negative two to negative
two, negative three,

341
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,600
negative 1016, that's
negative four-fifths.

342
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,740
So Israel candidates for

343
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,135
the maximum into
the function.

344
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,455
So how do we determine

345
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,870
what is the max
or min of f?

346
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,640
Well, we'd put them

347
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,720
all into the
function c. Well,

348
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,100
we get the biggest one is

349
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,970
the maximum and the

350
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,740
smallest one is
the minimum.

351
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,720
In this case, the
largest one here

352
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,584
is at 29 fifths,
which is about 5.8.

353
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,250
>> And the point
where that occurs,

354
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,034
sixth, negative
four-fifths.

355
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,790
>> And then the
minimum is one record

356
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,560
at the 0 comma negative two
