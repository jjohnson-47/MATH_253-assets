00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Hello and welcome
to a video on

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,590
calculus and vector
valued functions.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,110
This is an overview
of Section 11.2.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,725
This is a particularly
midi section

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,150
and it shows how we can

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,000
extend pretty much the
basics of calculus.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
122 are new objects

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,530
of vector valued functions.

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,230
First, let's
look at limits.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,820
If we have the limit of

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,290
a vector valued function,

12
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,520
it's defined in

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,875
the normal epsilon
delta away.

14
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,765
Now the notation here

15
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,429
can be somewhat confusing,

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:33,990
but what it's really saying

17
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,115
is straightforward,

18
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,230
especially if we
look at the picture.

19
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,750
If we're going to
take the limit of

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,085
a vector valued function

21
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,085
that may be changing,

22
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,550
then the limit actually

23
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,995
approaches a
another vector.

24
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,760
If for any circle of size

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,580
epsilon around

26
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,485
the distance between
the vectors,

27
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,180
that the vectors will

28
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,640
eventually be that
distance apart.

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,600
So let me begin

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
the animation to show
you what I mean.

31
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,790
>> So in this picture,

32
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,299
the green arrow is r of t.

33
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,520
>> The green arrow
is changing and

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,149
the blue arrow is
the limit vector.

35
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,890
>> And what we're
trying to understand

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,150
is what does it mean for

37
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,585
the green arrow to
approach the blue arrow?

38
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,940
What it means for the
green arrow to approach

39
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,765
the blue arrow means
that the distance

40
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,880
between the blue arrow

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,440
and the green
arrow given by

42
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,630
the red arrow
eventually has

43
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,875
magnitude less
than epsilon.

44
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,710
Now, epsilon was
arbitrarily given,

45
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,425
so I made a circle
of size epsilon.

46
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:48,940
But maybe you're not

47
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,110
convinced and
you say, Well,

48
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,514
make epsilon smaller
and shrink that circle.

49
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:57,100
>> And then if it's
still true that

50
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,890
eventually the red arrow

51
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,079
is within that
small circle.

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,570
>> That's how we conclude
that the limit of

53
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,054
the green arrow is going
to the blue arrow.

54
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:09,259
>> Okay?

55
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,280
>> So I'll play
this one more.

56
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,730
>> Time limits in

57
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,040
vectors can occur in

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,200
sort of more
ways than we do.

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,950
>> And we look at limits

60
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,000
in real valued functions,

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,260
can think there's more room

62
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,730
to spin around and
things like that.

63
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,630
The vector of the limit of

64
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,610
a vector valued function
can be found by

65
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,400
taking the limits
of the components.

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,680
So really this is just
a sneaky way of saying

67
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,820
now that we're going
to find limits

68
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,260
of vector valued functions,

69
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,915
we're just finding
two limits at once

70
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:43,340
for looking at R2 or three

71
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,885
limits at once and R3.

72
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:47,360
So all of the
properties of limits in

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,380
the techniques for taking

74
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,225
limits applies here.

75
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:51,860
May you have, you have them

76
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,480
occurring in each
coordinate separately.

77
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,130
Here's a vector-valued
function,

78
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,240
and it's asking
us to find the

79
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,380
limit as t goes to

80
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,575
0 using the
previous theorem.

81
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,060
The limit as t goes to

82
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,560
0 of the vector valued
function is the

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,790
same as the limit
as t goes to

84
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,949
0 of each individual
component.

85
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,124
>> And now we just have
some limit problems.

86
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,790
>> Remember, the
limit as t goes to

87
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,740
0 of sine t over

88
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,520
t is that famous
result where it's one.

89
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,470
And you could use
L'Hopital's rule to see

90
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,030
that the limit as

91
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,800
t goes to 0 of
a polynomial,

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
here is 0. Melody
as t goes to 0.

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,350
Cosine t. Since T
is continuous at 0,

94
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,700
you simply can plug 0

95
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,020
in and get the
value of one.

96
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,120
We can also talk
about continuity for

97
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,100
vector valued functions or

98
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,370
functions continuous
if it's a limit

99
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,200
exists at every
point and is

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,370
actually equal to the value

101
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,020
of the function
at that point.

102
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,840
So the same as in
Calculus One and Two,

103
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,880
except now our functions,

104
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,050
our vector valued
functions,

105
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,400
not real valued functions.

106
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,350
In this animation, I
show a discontinuity.

107
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,130
So we have

108
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,630
a vector valued function
spinning around

109
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,290
the circle but
suddenly moves,

110
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,760
so it's discontinuous.

111
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,520
The way you can
check continuity of

112
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,125
a vector valued function

113
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,790
under some circumstances

114
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,560
is to just look at
the continuity of

115
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,330
each component and then

116
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,410
its continuity in

117
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,760
the same sense
as Calculus one.

118
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,590
The derivative is differ.

119
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,300
A vector valued
function is defined

120
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,535
also similar to
calculus one.

121
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,905
It's the limit of the
difference quotient.

122
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,480
So the derivative
at a point

123
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,730
c is the limit as

124
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,600
h goes to 0 of the
difference quotient.

125
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,860
The derivative function at

126
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,200
any point t is
given by the same,

127
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,410
the notation that
we'll use for

128
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,365
derivatives of vector
valued functions,

129
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,260
pretty much the same as

130
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,895
real valued functions,

131
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,920
except we have
a vector arrow

132
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,270
over the vector
value function.

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,550
It's nice that
the derivative

134
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,915
of a vector valued function

135
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:09,110
is the derivative
of the components.

136
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,330
And this is actually

137
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,355
an extension of the limit.

138
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,260
Remember, derivatives
are just limits.

139
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,930
And this is just
saying that the,

140
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,805
we can take the derivative

141
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,320
in each compounded
because the

142
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,520
limit works at
each component.

143
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,090
What about vector
value functions

144
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,395
of three dimensions?

145
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:28,490
Here's an example we'll

146
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,540
be seeing several times.

147
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,030
What we have is
a simple helix,

148
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,489
cosine t, sine t and t.

149
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,564
>> Now we want to
compute the derivative.

150
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,890
>> So given that
that's cosine t,

151
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,420
sine t t, you

152
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,080
take the derivative of

153
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,030
each function separately.

154
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,310
And I'm, in this sketch,

155
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,390
what you see,
the derivative

156
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,010
is the red arrow.

157
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,200
The yellow arrow is

158
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,880
the vector valued
function itself,

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,740
and the red arrow
is the derivative.

160
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,470
And you might be
already noticing

161
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,210
some interesting
properties of

162
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,070
the derivative of
a vector valued

163
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,620
function. It's
the velocity.

164
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,540
Taking derivatives
of vector valued

165
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,680
functions allow us to

166
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,070
find the tangent to the
graph at the point.

167
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,360
And then we can find

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,800
the tangent line
to the graph at

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,410
a point where we're given,

170
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,705
here is the equation
for a tangent line.

171
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:26,180
And you should notice
its similarity to

172
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,340
the equation of
the linearization

173
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,860
of a function at a point
from calculus one,

174
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,750
you have the mesial at,

175
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,490
at the value C, you have

176
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,175
the initial value plus

177
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,800
scaled by the
direction vector,

178
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,720
the slope, what we

179
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,250
normally use in
calculus one.

180
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,460
So looking at our previous
example, cosine t,

181
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,665
sine t t, we can find

182
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:52,700
the equation of

183
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,025
the tangent line
at pi over two.

184
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:58,355
We simply put the values
into this function.

185
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,470
And as you can see
from the graph,

186
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,850
it looks like
the tangent line

187
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,200
exactly how we
would expect it.

188
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,970
Finally, smoothed
vectors are

189
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,135
vectors that have
a derivative.

190
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:11,720
So we know that

191
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,460
not all vectors
have a derivative.

192
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,729
>> Some R, R2
pointy or jerky.

193
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,800
>> The derivative
is continuous on

194
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,920
the interval and the
derivative is never 0.

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,665
Some important properties
of derivatives,

196
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:28,970
these are things that we

197
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,530
really get used
to in calculus.

198
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,000
One is that the
derivative of

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,020
a sum is the sum of the

200
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,505
derivatives and so on.

201
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,544
We can pull constants out.

202
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:38,210
>> Maybe the
surprising thing here

203
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,415
is that in properties 345,

204
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:43,640
the product rule
applies when we have

205
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,880
normal multiplication
and the dot product

206
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,724
and the cross product.

207
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:50,270
>> So that's a
nice, we don't have

208
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,770
to memorize anymore rules.

209
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,580
We have the product rule

210
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,900
that applies to all three,

211
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,115
and then the chain rule

212
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,300
applies in a similar way.

213
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,705
An important application
of physics is that

214
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:06,230
a vector that has
constant length,

215
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,430
so it might be moving,

216
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,945
but the length is the same,

217
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:12,065
is orthogonal to
its derivative.

218
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,510
This is how we describe
circular motion.

219
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,980
Now, integration, we have

220
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,390
a vector valued function.

221
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,930
We want to be able to

222
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,105
talk about its integral.

223
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,965
And just like in calc two,

224
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,320
its integral is defined as

225
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,830
the limit of these
Riemann sums.

226
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,375
The only different is that

227
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,710
each of the summands

228
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,320
in the Riemann sum is
now a vector value,

229
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,670
the integral, integral,

230
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,005
the vector valued function.

231
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,430
The components are just the

232
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,660
integrals of
the components.

233
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,800
>> And each
component we have

234
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,770
a integral that's just
like an integral.

235
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,470
>> And calculus to this

236
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,805
is an important example

237
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,665
that relates to physics.

238
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:06,530
Now I'm going to use
a language that is,

239
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,580
hasn't really
been introduced

240
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,390
in the text yet,

241
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,110
but it's really common

242
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,490
in a problem like this.

243
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,870
If we're given a vector
equation with r,

244
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,094
r of t, we'll call
that position.

245
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,760
>> Its derivative is

246
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,659
velocity and its derivative
is acceleration.

247
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,384
>> So in this example,

248
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:28,580
we're actually given an
acceleration vector.

249
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,955
We're given an
initial position

250
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,800
and an initial velocity.

251
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,500
And what we're
asked to find is to

252
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,390
find a vector equation

253
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,890
for the position itself.

254
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,450
So given a vector equation

255
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,950
for the acceleration,

256
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,180
we're actually
can find a vector

257
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,470
equation for the position.

258
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,175
First, we take
the acceleration

259
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,275
r double prime, and
we integrate it.

260
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,985
And we integrate
each coordinate

261
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:55,870
and we're left with

262
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,940
some constants
of integration.

263
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,620
But here is where we can

264
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,450
use the fact
that we're given

265
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,900
that the initial
velocity at 0 is 530.

266
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,400
>> So we can set this

267
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,964
vector expression
equal to 530.

268
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:09,760
>> And that allows us to

269
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,889
solve for the coefficients.

270
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,630
Then we can put
the coefficients

271
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,610
back in to r prime of

272
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,380
t. And that gives

273
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,600
us our update equation
for velocity.

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,190
So now we have a vector

275
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,930
that describes the
velocity in terms

276
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,930
of t. And then

277
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,015
we do the same thing
again to find position.

278
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,505
We integrate the velocity,

279
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,145
you integrate
each component,

280
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:33,184
we're left with constants
of integration,

281
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:34,850
but we're given a vector

282
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,920
of the initial velocity.

283
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,410
So we can set that equal
to negative seven,

284
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,230
negative one, to solve
for the constants.

285
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,450
In this case, we get
constants negative 70.

286
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,550
>> To put those back

287
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,560
in that we put

288
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,049
into the expression
for the position.

289
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,310
>> And then finally we get

290
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,630
our position vector.

291
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,765
>> The arc length
of a vector

292
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:02,554
is sound with the
following expression.

293
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:04,550
>> It's the integral of

294
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,380
the magnitude of the
velocity vector.
