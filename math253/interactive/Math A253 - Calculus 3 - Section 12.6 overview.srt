1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,460
Let's take a
look at section

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,949
12.6 on directional
derivatives.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,850
We've already seen

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,230
directional
derivatives when we

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,720
were introduced to
partial derivatives,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,820
the derivative
of a function

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,680
f with respect to x.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,845
We learned that was the
limit as h goes to 0,

9
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,140
the difference quotient
that we see here.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,090
Notice that the plus h

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,055
is in the x component
of the function.

12
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:27,960
And when the derivative
with respect to y,

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,805
the plus h is in the y

14
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:31,720
component of the function.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,670
So what's really going
on here is we are

16
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,710
approaching the
point x comma

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,110
y from the right,

18
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,835
assuming H is positive

19
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:41,990
in the first expression,

20
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,450
we're approaching from
above in the second.

21
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,085
So rarely are

22
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,080
finding a directional
derivative.

23
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,680
In a sense, we're

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,760
finding the rate
of change of

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,760
f from two different
directions.

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,890
Now we can try to

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,750
imagine that we
could try to

28
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,400
find the rate at which f is

29
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,905
changing from
any direction.

30
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:03,170
And that means that H,

31
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,180
If we add h and
both components and

32
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,210
a weight it corresponding
to the direction.

33
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,380
We said that these are

34
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,885
just two particular cases.

35
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:14,625
So how do we generalize it?

36
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,240
We can try to think of

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,590
the directional derivative

38
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,640
as coming from any

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,485
direction on the
unit circle.

40
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,240
So instead of one in

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,265
the X direction
and 0 in the y,

42
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,140
we can just
choose a point on

43
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,510
the unit circle
and U1 and U2.

44
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,390
And that's going to
show us how we can

45
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,920
approach the point x comma

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,510
y from any direction.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,810
So the definition of

48
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,950
the directional derivative

49
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,260
is just this
expression here.

50
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,600
The important
thing here is that

51
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,050
the direction vector
is a unit vector,

52
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,130
must have length one.

53
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,565
An easy way to find

54
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,710
the directional
derivative is

55
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,570
the dot product between

56
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,360
the vector of partial
derivatives and

57
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,180
the direction vector that

58
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,980
is given by this
expression here.

59
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,945
This actually
requires proof

60
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:16,670
and isn't entirely obvious,

61
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,110
but we need to
arrive at this fact

62
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,340
from the limit definition,

63
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,570
we can write this sum

64
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,430
as a dot product of
these two vectors.

65
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,625
The vector of partial
derivatives is actually

66
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,170
a very important vector

67
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,310
that's called the gradient.

68
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,095
And if we suppress
the argument here,

69
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:41,360
we see that the
directional derivative can

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,910
be written in a really
nice, clean formula.

71
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,290
The directional
derivative of

72
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,130
f in the direction of

73
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,780
u is the gradient of

74
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,610
f dot product with
the direction vector.

75
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,630
Let's take a look
at an example.

76
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,220
So the first thing
we need to do is

77
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,690
to find the
direction vector.

78
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,940
So if we're trying
to find the

79
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,110
derivative at the 0.1

80
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,075
comma two in the
direction of the origin.

81
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:07,205
That leaves us with
this vector here

82
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:09,770
from the 0.1 comma
two to the origin.

83
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,330
But remember the
direction vector

84
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,350
has to be a unit vector.

85
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,050
So we need to scale
it by its magnitude.

86
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,590
In this case, it's

87
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,630
magnitude is square
root of five.

88
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,610
So that leaves us with

89
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,199
a vector of length one.

90
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,880
>> And we can see
that direction

91
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,575
vector that we're
trying to find,

92
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:28,590
the derivative is given
by this vector u.

93
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,820
We can find the
partial derivatives of

94
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,894
the function at the point

95
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:37,055
>> Then we can take the

96
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:38,780
definition of the
directional derivative,

97
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,550
which is the dot
product of the gradient

98
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,890
at one comma two with
the direction vector.

99
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,660
And we see in
this case that

100
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,770
it comes out to two root

101
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:51,125
five. So more in
the gradient.

102
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,370
The gradient is of

103
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,660
a function of
two variables,

104
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,125
is a vector in
two-dimensional space.

105
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,820
So the dimension of

106
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,020
the gradient is
actually the

107
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,045
same as the domain
of the function.

108
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:04,160
And you can see
from this picture

109
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,540
here that we have graphed

110
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,490
a certain function and

111
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,080
then we've graphed
the gradient,

112
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,660
corresponding
gradient vectors in

113
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,000
the domain of the
function below.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,830
And the picture
kinda gives us

115
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,810
a Santos sense of what

116
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,150
these vectors are
telling us, right?

117
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,680
The, the direction of

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,200
the gradient vector
is somehow pointing

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,990
into the steepest direction

120
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,580
of increase of
the function.

121
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,960
And its magnitude is how

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,175
fast it's increasing.

123
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,630
So that is very
steep, that it's

124
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,325
a very long
gradient vector.

125
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:35,840
If it's relatively flat,

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,565
it's a short
gradient vector,

127
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:39,875
and we'll see
that in a second.

128
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,110
So there's some
natural questions.

129
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,240
And when you have a
function of two variables

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
at any particular point,

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,410
what direction is

132
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,955
the function
increasing? The moused?

133
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,050
What direction
is the function

134
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,730
increasing the least?

135
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,815
Or what functions are
decreasing the mouse?

136
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,900
And what directions are

137
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,105
there no change
in the variable?

138
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,520
So we take a look
at the formula

139
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,050
for the directional
derivative.

140
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,110
We can remember that
we have a formula for

141
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,850
the dot product
with respect

142
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,740
to the angle between
the two vectors.

143
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,480
So theta is the angle

144
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,630
between the gradient
and the direction.

145
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,800
Ready, we are
thinking about

146
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,390
being a particular point.

147
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,580
Then we get the
following formula here.

148
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,360
That the magnitude of

149
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,830
the gradient times
the magnitude of

150
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,630
the unit vectors times

151
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,505
the cosine of the
angle between them.

152
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:28,070
But u is a unit vector,

153
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,215
so it has length one.

154
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:33,035
So you can simplify
things a bit,

155
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,150
and this actually
tells us quite a

156
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,235
bit that says that

157
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:39,470
when is the
directional derivative

158
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,359
at F the greatest?

159
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,740
>> Well, it's the greatest.

160
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,705
>> When the cosine of
theta is the greatest,

161
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,580
The cosine of theta
is the greatest at

162
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,029
one that occurs
when theta is 0.

163
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,960
>> Ok?

164
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,340
>> So the directional
derivative

165
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,335
is the greatest
when theta is 0.

166
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:56,270
But theta is the
angle between

167
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,700
the gradient of f
in the direction.

168
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,695
So that must mean
the direction

169
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,870
is the same as
the gradient.

170
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,075
So the gradient itself

171
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,380
is a vector that points in

172
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,020
the direction of when

173
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,895
the directional derivative
is the gradient.

174
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:14,000
So the gradient
is a vector that

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,540
points in the direction
of steepest, the,

176
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,810
the steepest part
of the graph or

177
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,785
the greatest dissent,
when is it least?

178
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,030
It's when the
cosine of theta

179
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,680
is equal to negative one.

180
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,570
So that's when
theta is equal

181
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,480
to 180 degrees or pi,

182
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,870
which is

183
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,480
the opposite direction
of the gradient.

184
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,540
And then when is
it equal to 0?

185
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,680
When is there no change in

186
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
the function happens to

187
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,850
be when theta is
equal to pi over two.

188
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,460
And that means that
the angle between

189
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,795
the gradient and
the direction

190
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:49,550
is 90 degrees
or pi over two.

191
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,800
So they are orthogonal.

192
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,860
So the gradient
vector points in

193
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,039
the direction orthogonal
to the level curves.

194
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,450
And the level curves being

195
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,370
the curve in which
you walk along

196
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,780
the surface of the
function where you are not

197
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,970
changing and it's
in the z value.

198
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,480
Okay? So all of this is

199
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,370
formalized in the
following theorem.

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,555
Let's take a look
at an example

201
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,760
where we can use some
of this information.

202
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,125
So we're given a function

203
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,670
and we're thinking of water

204
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,720
being poured on at a

205
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,820
particular point
on the surface.

206
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,580
Here at x is one
and y is 1 fourth.

207
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,700
What path does it tapers?
It flows downhill.

208
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,665
So we want to do is set
up where will this,

209
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,790
if we think of
a particle of

210
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,200
water starting
at the surface,

211
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,865
in which direction
should I go?

212
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,140
Well, I should
probably go in

213
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,955
the direction of
the steepest,

214
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:47,720
steepest descent, right?

215
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,970
So negative the
gradient vector,

216
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,440
the gradient vector points

217
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,995
in the direction of

218
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:55,070
steepest and the negative,

219
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,240
the gradient
vector points in

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,980
the opposite
direction where

221
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,750
it's the steepest downhill.

222
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,750
So the rate, right,

223
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,310
if we have the path of

224
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,690
water particle, the rate,

225
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,399
which is the derivative,

226
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,545
has to be in the direction

227
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:11,990
of the negative of
the gradient vector.

228
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,850
But we can find the
gradient factor

229
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,800
by taking the
partial derivatives

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,975
and we can just
set it equal.

231
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:24,320
Now, if two vectors
are parallel,

232
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,655
are pointing in the
same direction,

233
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,950
mathematically,
that means that

234
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,660
one vector is a constant

235
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,010
multiple of the other.

236
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,555
So in the set up here,

237
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,440
we're just going to say

238
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,925
there is some constant C.

239
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,400
Don't necessarily
know what it is yet,

240
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,410
but the negative
of the gradient

241
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,660
is some constant times the,

242
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,690
the rate of change of
this water particle.

243
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,800
So you can take the
partial derivatives,

244
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,820
stick those into
this equation.

245
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,190
And that gives us two
equations involving

246
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,740
x and x prime and
y and y prime.

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,930
So it can you
solve for c and

248
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,115
set those equal
to each other?

249
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:04,465
That gives us
the following.

250
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,070
And then since
we're dividing by

251
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,275
a small change in
T and both sides,

252
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,160
that allows us to

253
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,390
write the equation
without D

254
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,675
t. Then we can
integrate both sides.

255
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:17,020
That gives us the
following antiderivatives.

256
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,645
Then multiply it times
both sides times four,

257
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:20,230
because there's

258
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,865
a new constant
of integration.

259
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,200
Notice that we get a

260
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,180
constant of integration
from both sides,

261
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,470
but we can kind of
combine that into

262
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,540
one new constant
integration.

263
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,310
C1 then multiply
both sides times

264
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,175
four gives us a new
constant, iteration C2.

265
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:36,410
Use some properties
of logarithms here.

266
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,150
Raise both sides to

267
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,170
the E power to remove
the natural logs.

268
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,600
And we can use

269
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,295
the properties of
an exponential.

270
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,540
Notice that e to a

271
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,580
constant is just a
constant itself.

272
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,330
And that gives
us the following

273
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,620
equation in the x,

274
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,970
y axis,

275
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,265
which the direction of
the water must flow.

276
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,610
Now we have this new
constant c For we

277
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,140
know that we're going
to start at the

278
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,895
0.1 comma 1 fourth.

279
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,830
So we can put
that in for x and

280
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,140
y and solve for C four.

281
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,570
And that gives us the curve

282
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,790
which the path the
water will follow.

283
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,510
Ok? So if we
parameterize that curve,

284
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,615
we get t comma
14 t squared.

285
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:27,830
And if you graph the level

286
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,180
curves of the function,

287
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,920
we can see in

288
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,740
this animation here that
that parametrization

289
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,130
does indeed always find

290
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,720
itself perpendicular

291
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,910
to the level curves
of the function.

292
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,680
Which means as
it travels down,

293
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,870
it really is going down
the steepest path.

294
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,025
And this animation
on the right,

295
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,800
we're just graphing the
same, the same curve,

296
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,150
but in
three-dimensional space

297
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,830
with the corresponding
z value.

298
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,190
You can see if

299
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,034
a water droplet
was started here.

300
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,760
>> It's going to
follow the path is

301
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:11,344
indicated more on
the gradient vector.

302
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,730
>> Given a function
of three variables,

303
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,965
we can also find its
gradient vector,

304
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,230
which is the vector of
partial derivatives

305
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,045
with respect to
each variable.

306
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,760
And again, the
directional derivative is

307
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,380
the same formula where

308
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,280
you're taking
the dot product,

309
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,140
the gradient, with
its direction.

310
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,180
In this case, in
three-dimensional space.

311
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,160
In R3, the direction vector

312
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,210
has three components.

313
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,030
And this is just
a summary of what

314
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,140
we've already discussed for

315
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,340
functions of two variables.

316
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,840
But it's also true
for functions of

317
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,370
three variables that we can

318
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,320
find the maximum value
of the function.

319
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,705
It's the magnitude
of the gradient.

320
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:50,390
The direction of
the maximum value

321
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,715
is the direction of
the gradient itself.

322
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,470
The minimum value
is negative.

323
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,810
The gradient and

324
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,100
the director or
the I'm sorry,

325
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,210
the minimum value
is negative

326
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,500
the magnitude of
the gradient,

327
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,615
the direction is
negative the gradient.

328
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:06,200
And then when
the gradient is

329
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,120
orthogonal to the direction

330
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,740
is when there is no
change in the function.
