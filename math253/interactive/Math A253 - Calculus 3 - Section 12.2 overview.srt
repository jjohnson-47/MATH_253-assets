1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's take a look at
an overview of section

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,590
12.2 on Limits and

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,480
Continuity of
multivariable functions.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,260
We have to remind

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,640
ourselves of
some properties

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,190
of real numbers and
sets of real numbers.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,855
And real numbers.
So we can look at

8
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,644
larger sets into, in
three-dimensional space.

9
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,760
>> In calculus
12, we usually

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,740
look at just
intervals, right?

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,300
>> Do we have a
closed interval

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,905
from 0 to one?

13
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:27,420
And this is a set of

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,715
real numbers that
are between 01,

15
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:31,735
but also includes
the endpoints.

16
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:34,415
And when it includes
all of the end points,

17
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,170
we say it's closed.

18
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,490
We're going to call
these endpoints

19
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,310
boundary points
from here on out.

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,384
You can also have
half open intervals,

21
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:46,205
which are neither
open nor closed,

22
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:48,530
where the interval

23
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,255
contains one of
the endpoints.

24
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:52,130
And then you have
an open interval

25
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,060
where it doesn't contain

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,395
any of the end points.

27
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:58,100
The open interval, we
call it open because

28
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,035
every point in the interval

29
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,000
is an interior point,

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,889
which sort of means
it's on the inside.

31
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,620
So you want to, we want
to extend these ideas

32
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,370
to sets in two-dimensional
space, or an R2.

33
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,640
For looking at sets
in two dimensions,

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,580
we want to be able to
consider the open disk.

35
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,130
That's a very important

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,300
set in two dimensions,

37
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,695
which is just the circle,

38
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:29,465
the inside of a circle

39
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,250
of radius one,
in this case,

40
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,300
bore of any radius,

41
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,735
we have closed sets.

42
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,490
And closed sets
are sets that

43
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,275
contain the
entire boundary.

44
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:40,340
So every point that's on

45
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,110
the edge is
contained inside

46
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,535
the set that are

47
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,610
open sets which do not
contain the boundary.

48
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,590
And in fact,
every point and

49
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,840
an open set is an
interior point,

50
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,075
which means that it's
completely surrounded

51
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:56,180
by other points in the set.

52
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,740
And then there
are sets that are

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,005
neither open nor closed.

54
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:01,850
So when we're talking about

55
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,220
functions of two or
three variables,

56
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,955
the language of open
and closed sets is

57
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,950
very useful in
the way that open

58
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,960
and closed intervals
where in calculus one.

59
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,530
Also we want to be

60
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,700
familiar with
the idea being

61
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,910
bounded and
unbounded as a set.

62
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,660
So here we defined
bounded to mean

63
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,015
that the set can

64
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:28,850
be contained in
some giant desk.

65
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,595
So in the example
on the left here,

66
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:33,710
we have our set
and there's,

67
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,090
there exists at least one

68
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,590
giant disk that
contains it.

69
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,730
So that means that site is

70
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,070
bounded on the right,

71
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,540
we have this
sort of infinite

72
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,459
sector that goes forever.

73
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,945
>> There is no disc
that can contain that,

74
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:49,489
that area right there.

75
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,200
>> So that's an
unbounded set.

76
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,509
>> So here's an example.

77
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,980
>> Determine the domain of

78
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,250
the function one
over x minus y,

79
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,340
whether it's closed,
open, or neither.

80
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,320
Well, the domain or

81
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,190
the set of points where

82
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,480
the function is defined.

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,310
In this case, the only
thing that can go

84
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,830
bad is if the
denominator is 0.

85
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,600
So the domain is
the set of points

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,390
where x minus y is not 0.

87
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,190
And that's the set
of points where

88
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,705
y is not equal to x.

89
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:23,360
So that's everything except

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,830
for the line y equal to x.

91
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,090
This set is open because

92
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,565
if you take any
point in the set,

93
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:33,650
you are completely
surrounded

94
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,060
by other points in the set.

95
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,320
That means that
every point is

96
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,205
an interior point,
the sets unbounded,

97
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,960
because we can kind of

98
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,970
see that any large disk

99
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,560
that we try is not

100
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,945
going to contain
the entire set.

101
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:51,570
So the domain here is
open and unbounded.

102
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,680
We also wanna
be able to talk

103
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,700
about the limit of

104
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,535
a function of two
or three variables.

105
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,470
The way we talk about
a limit is very

106
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,270
similar to calculus one.

107
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,300
But when we approach a
point in the domain,

108
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,460
now we are approaching

109
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,310
from other points
in the domain.

110
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,350
And it's not just from
left or the right,

111
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,880
or above or below, but

112
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,425
approaching in any way.

113
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:18,410
But the definition
of the limit is very

114
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,730
similar to the definition

115
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,455
of a limit from
calculus one.

116
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:24,110
We say that the
function f approaches

117
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,290
owl as we approach
the point x-naught,

118
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,490
y-naught here, if for
any given epsilon,

119
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,010
tiny, tiny small
number that you may

120
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,650
choose epsilon that we

121
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,249
can find a disk

122
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,365
small enough so that

123
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,420
every point
within the disk,

124
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,520
if we evaluate
the function,

125
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,260
its difference
from the limit

126
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,624
is less than epsilon.

127
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,639
>> So do not be Technical.

128
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,020
>> Where we can
say is that as

129
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,105
we approach the point,

130
00:04:56,105 --> 00:05:00,180
the functions values
approach the limit l,

131
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,500
we have properties
of limits

132
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,035
just as we did
in calculus one.

133
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,610
The important thing here

134
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,170
is all of these
properties are very

135
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,640
nice and we take
advantage of

136
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,500
them at the limit
of the sums,

137
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,420
the sum of the
limits that we

138
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,520
can pull constants
outside of the limits.

139
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,840
And we can take the limit

140
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,890
of a multiplication,

141
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,450
and that's just
the multiplication

142
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,220
of the limits and so on.

143
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,620
But the thing to
keep in mind is that

144
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,095
these properties
only only work,

145
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,310
especially properties like

146
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,775
number 4567 down here,

147
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,205
if the separate limits
exist to themselves,

148
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,245
so you can create
situations

149
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:43,220
where maybe the
product limit exists.

150
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,405
So maybe number five,

151
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,710
you can multiply
two functions,

152
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,045
then the limit exists,

153
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,205
but the functions
themselves,

154
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,870
the limit may not exist.

155
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,190
In that case,
number five maybe

156
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,530
broken and maybe you

157
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,790
will not even
get the product.

158
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,865
This is a reminder
that in calculus one,

159
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,560
calculus two, when
you wanted to

160
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,284
take limits of functions,

161
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:06,830
we can determine
if the limit

162
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,515
existed by approaching
from the right,

163
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:10,670
which we had a
little plus, and

164
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,710
approaching from the
left a little minus.

165
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,690
And if we got
the same value

166
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,625
as we approached from
the right and the left,

167
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,710
than that means
the limit exists.

168
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,530
We can't do that in
two dimensional space

169
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,450
because we can approach

170
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,130
from infinitely
many directions.

171
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,400
So we want to be able
to look at limits of

172
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,190
functions and determine
if they exist or not.

173
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,140
And if they exist,
how can we find them?

174
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,970
So first, we'll look
at an example to

175
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,740
show that a limit
does not exist.

176
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,620
The limit has to
exist if it's

177
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,995
the same as we approach
from any direction.

178
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,540
So an easy way
to get started

179
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,280
here is to try
approaching from

180
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,350
some simple directions and

181
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,005
then see if we're
getting the same limit.

182
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,120
So in this case,
we're approaching

183
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,250
the 0 comma 0.

184
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,410
And some easy directions

185
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,670
to try would be maybe

186
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,819
from the right
or from above.

187
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,415
>> If we approach
from the right,

188
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,320
that means the y
value is always

189
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,234
0 and x is a
positive number.

190
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,090
>> And if we put

191
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,830
those values into
the function,

192
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,180
we see we've kind of gotten

193
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,199
rid of the y-value.

194
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,460
So we're just
finding the limit

195
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,990
of a function of a
single variable.

196
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,010
>> Again, we see that
we're just taking

197
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,784
the limit of 0 over X
squared equals to 0.

198
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,090
>> So the limit of

199
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,870
this function as we

200
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,820
approach from
the right is 0.

201
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,560
And similarly, if we

202
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,240
approach from above,
in that case,

203
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,640
the x value is 0, and

204
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,930
we're taking the
limit of 0 over

205
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,790
y squared equals to 0.

206
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,980
And because we could

207
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,960
have just put the
limit as x goes to 0,

208
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,044
even from the
left or below.

209
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:48,590
>> Because of these
squared terms,

210
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,374
we also would
have gotten 0.

211
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,220
>> So for this
particular function,

212
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,060
if we approach from

213
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,590
the left to
right, we get 0.

214
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,390
And if we approach
from the top

215
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,054
or the bottom, we get 0.

216
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,340
>> But the problem

217
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,989
is saying that the
limit doesn't exist.

218
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,730
>> Although we seem
to have some evidence

219
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,475
that the limit does
exist and it is 0.

220
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,260
But just because
it's approaching

221
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,210
0 from these
directions doesn't

222
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,040
mean the limit 0
because it can approach

223
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,720
from where it has to be

224
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,910
0 as we approach
from any direction.

225
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,160
So the next thing
to try is to

226
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,265
approach along an
arbitrary line.

227
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:24,050
So let's say we want to

228
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,150
approaches 0 comma
0 along a line

229
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,690
with slope m. While
we know a line that

230
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,250
goes through 0 comma 0 with

231
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,520
slope m is y equals to m x.

232
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,865
So we can do is
parameterize

233
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,160
that line with
a vector valued

234
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,815
function with a t for x.

235
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:45,214
And then the y value
would be M times t.

236
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:49,474
>> We can approach 0
comma 0 as t goes to 0.

237
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:52,040
>> And you can see in
these expressions here,

238
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,570
the limit of the
function along

239
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,060
the line is we
approach our x and

240
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,055
our y values with t

241
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:01,490
and M t that are
parameterizations.

242
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,410
And then the
t's cancel out.

243
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,120
And we can see
that the limit of

244
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,310
the function as
we approach along

245
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,080
a line with slope m

246
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,780
is three m over m
squared plus one.

247
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,580
So it actually depends

248
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,080
on the slope of the line.

249
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,580
So for slope,

250
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,860
two different slopes give

251
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,240
us two different limits.

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,010
So therefore, the
limit cannot exist.

253
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,635
Now let's look
at an example

254
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,105
where the limit does exist,

255
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,265
and we need to prove it.

256
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:33,020
To get started with these,

257
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,859
it helps to try some
values x and y.

258
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,660
>> Maybe is layer 0 comma

259
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,339
0 with a computer
or a calculator?

260
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,930
>> See what you get
and see if there's

261
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,240
evidence that what
the limit might be.

262
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,055
Here I graphed the function

263
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:47,960
with the 3D calculator.

264
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,880
And this is what the
function looks like.

265
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,470
And we're looking at
the point right over

266
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,095
here at 0 comma 0.

267
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,885
So it seems that if
a limit does exist,

268
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:59,730
the limits probably 0

269
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,570
So we need to prove that
the limit is indeed

270
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,090
0 using the epsilon
definition.

271
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,485
So given a small
number epsilon,

272
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:15,035
we need to produce a delta.

273
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:18,020
So that numbers within

274
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,105
the disk of radius delta,

275
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:21,620
which satisfies
square root of

276
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,240
x squared plus y squared

277
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,640
will imply that anytime

278
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,290
we have those x comma wise,

279
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,375
if we put them
into the function,

280
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,490
that number's distance from

281
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,960
0 will be less
than epsilon.

282
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,610
So these take practice

283
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,890
and we can go through
some examples.

284
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,310
And it's sort of

285
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,890
an advanced
technical problem,

286
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,410
but it's best to
work backwards.

287
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,345
And when you do that,

288
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,100
we see in this example
that there was

289
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,085
a judicious
choice for delta,

290
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,870
which was the square root

291
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,030
of epsilon over five.

292
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,070
And the proof is
in the putting it,

293
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,435
let's see if it works.

294
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:01,820
So if you take the
absolute value of

295
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,030
the function we get here,

296
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,195
and we can separate
it like this,

297
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:09,920
which helps us
determine which are

298
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,900
the parts are, are growing,

299
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,375
in which the parts
are small, we can,

300
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,920
all we're trying to
do is prove that this

301
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,020
is less than epsilon.

302
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,370
And we're going
to use the fact

303
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,440
that the square root

304
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,130
of x squared plus y

305
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,884
squared is less than delta.

306
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,060
>> But here, y

307
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,830
squared over x squared
plus y squared,

308
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,180
that part is less

309
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,800
than or equal
to one, right?

310
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,210
>> Because the bottom

311
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,140
here is always going to be

312
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,190
greater than the top.

313
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,200
So that that
expression is now less

314
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,510
than the absolute value
of five x squared.

315
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,660
But since we have x

316
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,130
squared plus y
squared is less than

317
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,439
delta squared because
of our assumption here.

318
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:52,640
>> That means x squared

319
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,779
is less than all of that.

320
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,890
>> So we have x squared

321
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,180
being less than
delta squared.

322
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,815
And then we can replace

323
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:03,260
delta squared with
epsilon over five,

324
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,285
because that was our
choice for delta.

325
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:08,630
And we can see that
that is all epsilon.

326
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,400
So when you string

327
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,010
these equalities and
inequalities together,

328
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,095
what we've
concluded is that

329
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:18,080
0 arc candidate
for a limit,

330
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,970
the distance from f is

331
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,160
less than epsilon for
that given delta.

332
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,005
Therefore, this limit

333
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,640
exists and is equal to 0.

334
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,330
We can also talk about

335
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,445
continuity of a function.

336
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,410
The continuity,
the continuity of

337
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,250
a function is defined

338
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,080
similar to calculus one.

339
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,060
Its continuous
if it's a limit

340
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,430
exists and it's equal

341
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,605
to the value at that point.

342
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,300
So that's what
it means to be

343
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,380
continuous at a point.

344
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,330
And it's continuous
on an entire set.

345
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,590
If it's continuous at every

346
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,610
point in that whole set.

347
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,830
The properties of
continuous functions are

348
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,085
also analogous
to calculus one.

349
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,285
And this is a relief

350
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,350
because that means that we

351
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,840
don't have to remember
anything new here.

352
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,244
That when you have
continuous functions,

353
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,550
if you add them
together, you

354
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,945
also get a
continuous function.

355
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:10,370
You multiply them
times a constant,

356
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,945
you also get a
continuous function.

357
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,580
So these are very
useful in actually

358
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,544
proving that a function
is continuous.

359
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,690
If we can view
that function

360
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,510
as simpler pieces of
continuous function,

361
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,550
we want to show that

362
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,394
a function might
be continuous.

363
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,885
>> This is asking if
it's continuous at 0,

364
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,985
if it's continuous at 00,

365
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:35,029
that must mean the
limit must exist.

366
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,635
>> The limit of
the function

367
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,790
as x goes to 0 must

368
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,420
exist and be equal
to 0 comma 0.

369
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,370
So we can check

370
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,115
the 0 comma 0 if
we put it in,

371
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:49,130
that gives us the top were

372
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,650
in the top case,
and that's one.

373
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,785
And that's the same
as the limit as,

374
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:57,949
as, as x comma y
approaches 0 comma 0.

375
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,240
>> The way we can do that

376
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,289
is this little trick.

377
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:01,820
>> And this is kind
of reminiscent

378
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,560
of some limit tricks
from calculus.

379
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,575
One, This is separating

380
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:09,215
the expression in terms
of the x's and y's.

381
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,670
And since we're,
we're going to use

382
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,290
that previous theorem
that says that

383
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,180
the limit of a product

384
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,680
is the product
of the limits.

385
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
And of course,
the limit here on

386
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,410
the right is just one.

387
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,545
The cosine is
continuous at 0,

388
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,510
so the limit is one,

389
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,680
the same as what
we got if we

390
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,030
put in the 0 comma 0.

391
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,040
So indeed it is
continuous at 00.

392
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,750
>> You can do a similar
kind of analysis

393
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,100
to show that it's actually

394
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,300
continuous everywhere
because of these limits

395
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:47,524
holding for functions
of three variables.

396
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,070
>> Everything we
just discussed for

397
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,275
a function of two
variables is also true,

398
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,540
except that we have
these additional terms

399
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,650
with the z values in them.
