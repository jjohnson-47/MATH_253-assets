00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello and welcome
to a short video

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,855
on the dot product.

3
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:06,880
This is an overview
of section 10.3.

4
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:10,860
>> The dot product
definition is this.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,215
If you have two
vectors, U and D,

6
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,300
then the dot product
is defined as

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,560
the sum of the product

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,909
of the respective
coordinates.

9
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,560
>> So if you have
two vectors,

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,735
U and V in two dimensions,

11
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:25,490
you just multiply U1, V1,

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,649
multiply u2, v2,
add them up.

13
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:29,300
>> And the same goes with

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,650
three-dimensional
vectors or

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,524
four-dimensional vectors
for that matter.

16
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:33,740
>> So the dot product is

17
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,964
relatively easy to find.

18
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:35,960
>> Let's find
the dot product

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,890
for these two vectors.

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
The vector x dot
product with

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,000
the vector y is
equal to this case,

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,070
two times negative one

23
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,890
plus negative two times

24
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,340
0 plus five times three.

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,755
>> And that gives
us negative two

26
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:06,175
plus 0 plus 15,
which is 13.

27
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:09,385
Notice that the
dot product is

28
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:12,235
a way to multiply
two vectors,

29
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:14,604
except the answer that
you get is a number.

30
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:16,090
>> So that's pretty
important. When you take

31
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,230
a vector dot product with

32
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,435
another vector,
you get a number.

33
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,880
And what that number
is very important.

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,875
And it ends up telling
us information

35
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,530
about the angle between
the two vectors.

36
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,040
>> So the properties of

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,870
the dot product r here,

38
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,730
and these are things

39
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,084
to just sort of
casually be aware of.

40
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:37,900
>> The commutative
property means we can take

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,980
the dot product in

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,200
either order and
get the same thing.

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
It distributes the way that

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,780
multiplication typically

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,830
distributes with numbers.

46
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,580
But keep in mind that

47
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,155
these things are vectors.

48
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:51,124
Scalars behave nicely
with the dot product.

49
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,370
>> You can take a scale.

50
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,780
>> If you multiply
a scalar times

51
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,205
the dot product
of two vectors,

52
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,750
that's just the
same as multiplying

53
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,390
the scalar times one
of those two vectors,

54
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,730
the 0 vector, which is

55
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,130
a unique vector
that's just zeros,

56
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,870
multiply it times
any vector,

57
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,105
and it has a dot
product of 0.

58
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:10,864
And number five is
especially important.

59
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,720
>> It says that

60
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,130
the dot product
of a vector with

61
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,999
itself is the
magnitude squared.

62
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,100
>> So this is
actually really

63
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,630
nice because
it's another way

64
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,960
for us to find the
magnitude of a vector.

65
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,230
So how does the dot-product

66
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,789
relate to an angle?

67
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,480
>> That's the width?

68
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,520
>> This equation here, so

69
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,200
just says that the dot
product is equal to

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,210
the norm or the magnitude
of the two vectors

71
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,230
multiplied
together times the

72
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,805
cosine of the angle
between them.

73
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:42,190
And an important
thing is to

74
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,784
understand where that
formula comes from.

75
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:46,030
>> And I won't go

76
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,050
through it on
the video here,

77
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,195
but feel free to contact
me with questions.

78
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:51,745
But if you have two
vectors, u and v,

79
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,070
what you can do is

80
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,560
look at this picture
here where you

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,680
have u minus v And
that built a triangle.

82
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,700
>> And you can
apply the law of

83
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,890
cosines to that
triangle from trig,

84
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,030
and you get exactly
this formula.

85
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,820
So that means if you can

86
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,575
solve for cosine theta,

87
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,960
and then you take
the cosine inverse.

88
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,850
We have a formula to find

89
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,595
the angle between
two vectors.

90
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:20,660
Keep in mind that

91
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,640
the cosine inverse
function is

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,810
a function that
always returns

93
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,375
an angle between 0 and pi.

94
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,320
So when you're finding

95
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,760
the angle between
two vectors,

96
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,680
you can of course look at

97
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,735
the shortest angle, right?

98
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:33,530
And then you can look at

99
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,640
though angle that
goes all the way

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,410
around this angle

101
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,700
that if you use
this formula,

102
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,140
this will always give
you the angle that's

103
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,820
the shortest angle
between two vectors.

104
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,510
And important
concept is the

105
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,295
one of orthogonal vectors.

106
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:47,930
So two vectors are

107
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,795
orthogonal if their
dot product is 0.

108
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,820
And orthogonal means it's

109
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,280
the general idea
of perpendicular.

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,979
So if two vectors
are orthogonal,

111
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,990
if you take the dot
product, you get 0.

112
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,070
So it's a really nice,

113
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,410
easy way to check to see if

114
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,534
two vectors are
perpendicular or not.

115
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,545
>> Now if their
dot product is 0,

116
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,255
let's just go back
to this slide

117
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:12,635
and take a look at

118
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:17,930
the formula here for
the cosine of theta.

119
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,340
>> If the dot
product is 0, that

120
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,600
means the cosine
of the angle

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,770
between them is equal to

122
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,260
0 divided by
something which is 0.

123
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,095
So if the cosine
of an angle is 0,

124
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,490
we know from trig that that

125
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,600
means that the angle has to

126
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,090
be 90 degrees
or 270 degrees.

127
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,275
>> But because
we're looking at

128
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,645
the smaller angle,
it's 90-degree angle.

129
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:37,325
So the dot product being 0

130
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,069
means that the angle
is 90 degrees.

131
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:40,850
>> So they really are

132
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,100
perpendicular
in that sense.

133
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,979
What are some examples
of orthogonal vectors?

134
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,559
>> So that's kinda fun
to play around with.

135
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,970
>> I'll give you
just a couple

136
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,465
fun ones to look at.

137
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,710
You could look
at the vector

138
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,620
in two dimensional space,

139
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,430
right, with 11 going
one in the x direction,

140
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,019
one in the y direction.

141
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,390
>> And you could
look at the vector y

142
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,990
going one in the
x direction,

143
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,279
negative one in
the y direction.

144
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,570
>> And we can
see if we take

145
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,680
the dot product of these,

146
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,520
we get one times one

147
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,784
plus one times negative
one equals to 0.

148
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,560
>> So those are
two vectors in

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,060
two dimensional space
whose dot product is

150
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,100
0. And there are
many others.

151
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,740
Any two vectors who meet
at a 90 degree angle

152
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,620
have a dot product of
0 and R orthogonal.

153
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,400
An important idea
in vectors is

154
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,635
that a vector projection,

155
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,200
especially in
physics if you have

156
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,525
forces going in
two directions.

157
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,270
So let's say you wanted
to pull an object in

158
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,659
the direction of v
in this picture.

159
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,600
>> But some things
in the way perhaps.

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,860
So you can only

161
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,780
pull it in the
direction of view.

162
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,730
You'd, you'd
want to know how

163
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,010
much of that force that

164
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,840
you're pulling from
you is actually

165
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,164
in the direction
that you care about.

166
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:17,930
>> So how much of

167
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,015
that is in the
direction of v?

168
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,025
And so that vector

169
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,440
is the blue vector
that you see here.

170
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,940
Which is written in this
strange way to probe

171
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,970
project the
projection PRO J

172
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,025
underscore V. And then you,

173
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:37,010
so the underscore,
the vector that's

174
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,545
here in the subscript

175
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:41,750
is the one that you're
projecting onto.

176
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,330
So this is an
important vector.

177
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,710
Whenever you have
two other vectors,

178
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,960
you can, you can get
this vector from it.

179
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,800
>> Another important idea

180
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,715
with the dot product

181
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:01,864
is the orthogonal
decomposition.

182
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:04,010
>> So just like in
the previous slide,

183
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,259
we talked about the
projection of U on to V.

184
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,300
>> Well, that gives
us, that gives rise to

185
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,260
another vector
which is W here.

186
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,960
And we can see that
in our picture,

187
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,629
that if you take w,

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,990
If you take the
projection plus w,

189
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,850
you get you there.

190
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,170
If you take w plus

191
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,239
the projection,
you get you.

192
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,910
>> So what is, what
is this vector w?

193
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,710
>> Anyways, it is

194
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,755
u minus the
projection vector.

195
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:42,670
So this is a way of
writing the vector,

196
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,295
the vector u in two parts.

197
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,080
The part that's
parallel with V and

198
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,494
the part that's
perpendicular to B.

199
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:51,190
>> And this is
just as useful

200
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,450
because maybe V is

201
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,190
an important direction that

202
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,065
we're working with on a,

203
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,580
on a certain incline.

204
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,740
And we just want to
write everything

205
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,169
about you in terms
of that vector v.

206
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,790
>> And this formula

207
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,440
gives us a nice
way to do that.

208
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,545
>> One application for

209
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,120
dot product that's
very important

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,334
and in physics is
the concept of work.

211
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,405
>> And you might
know that work

212
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,914
is defined as force
times distance.

213
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:23,890
>> Now that we're

214
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,240
talking about
vectors, though,

215
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,179
we can talk about
work in a better way.

216
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,115
>> And we can talk
about work in a way

217
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,330
when we have force not

218
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,975
necessarily given in
exactly the direction

219
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,999
of the that we want.

220
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,320
>> So you can see
in this picture,

221
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,370
in this example, a box

222
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,615
is pushed along a ramp,

223
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,760
the raises over a
distance of 15 feet by

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,900
applying 50 pounds of

225
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,265
force as shown
in the figure.

226
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:48,650
Compute the work done well.

227
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,540
>> So we have a ramp
that's 15 feet long,

228
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,800
three feet high, and

229
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,865
then there's a box
sitting on it.

230
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,485
We'd like to
pull the box up,

231
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:55,880
but we can see that we're

232
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,650
pulling the box with

233
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,180
a force that's not really

234
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,980
parallel with the ramp.

235
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,750
It's being pulled up at

236
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,860
a 30 degree angle from

237
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,335
the, from the horizontal.

238
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:08,960
So without vectors, we

239
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,330
couldn't really
calculate the work here.

240
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,030
But because we can take

241
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,355
the vector projection of

242
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,074
F onto the direction
that we want.

243
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:21,950
>> Now the direction
of the ramp,

244
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,080
we get a nice
formula for that.

245
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,700
And it turns out, and I'm

246
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,060
the derivation

247
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,500
from the vector
projection two,

248
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,345
this formula is
in our book,

249
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,340
but it turns out
that you can

250
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,930
find this work
by just taking

251
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,985
the dot product
of the force

252
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:40,610
with the direction that

253
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,855
the work is being done.

254
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,910
So here in this case,

255
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,860
the work is just
the dot product of

256
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,349
the force with
the direction d.

257
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,615
>> And we can see
that the ramp

258
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,250
has a change in acts of

259
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,049
15 and a change
of y of three.

260
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,575
>> And that's what gives,

261
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,220
because our D vector,

262
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,440
and then we have
our force vector,

263
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,660
which is, it's
a force of 50,

264
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,880
but 3030 degrees of

265
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,410
that is in the x direction,

266
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,080
and it's a 30 degree angle.

267
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,460
So cosine of 30

268
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,840
is the portion in
the x direction.

269
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,910
Sine of 30 is of course
on the y direction.

270
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,050
So that gives us
this simple formula.

271
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,775
You can find the
cosine of 30 and

272
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,500
sine of 30 in the same
way we always do.

273
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,690
And trig multiply
both those times 50,

274
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,950
take the dot product and

275
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,135
we can see that
the total work

276
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:33,055
is 724.5 foot pounds.

277
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,615
So this is a
very convenient

278
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:36,980
formula for finding work.
