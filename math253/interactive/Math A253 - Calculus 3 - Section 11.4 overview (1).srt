1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Let's take a look at unit,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,135
tangent and normal vectors.

3
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:05,100
This is an overview
of Section 11.4 in

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,530
a book or call

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,120
it the velocity vector is

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,970
the derivative of
the position vector.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,550
The unit tangent vector is

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,490
the velocity vector
divided by its magnitude,

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,689
which scales it to
have length. One.

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,880
>> Picture here we see
a curve and we see

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,350
a couple instances of

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,064
the velocity vector
scaled by length one.

13
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,985
>> So what you
see in red is

14
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:35,250
the unit tangent vectors
at those points.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,530
Similarly, since

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,560
the unit tangent
vector is constant,

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,615
we learned earlier that the

18
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:46,430
derivative of a constant

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,600
vector valued function

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,285
is always orthogonal to
the function itself.

21
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,220
And that's the case
here. If we take

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,570
the unit tangent vector

23
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,175
and take its derivative,

24
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,710
that gives us a
vector orthogonal to

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,320
the tangent vector called
the normal vector.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,870
And then we scale it
by its length to get

27
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,670
the unit normal vector
unit means one.

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,260
So now we have two
vectors of length one.

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,420
We have the
tangent vector and

30
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,660
we have

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,404
the normal vector which
is perpendicular.

32
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:15,655
>> Let's take a
look at an example.

33
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,620
This is the simple helix

34
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,704
that we've looked at
in previous videos.

35
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,030
>> Find the unit tangent
vector at pi over

36
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,260
two and the unit

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,715
normal vector
at pi over two.

38
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,710
And graph the
initial points where

39
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,880
the vectors are sitting

40
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,230
at the position
pi over two.

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,400
To find the unit
tangent vector,

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,350
we just need to
take our vector

43
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,730
valued function r position,

44
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,920
take its derivative, find

45
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,860
its magnitude with
the distance formula.

46
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,500
And then the unit
tangent vector is

47
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,855
just the velocity divided
by its magnitude.

48
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:52,200
And that comes together
as this vector here.

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,535
Now add pi over two.

50
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:57,470
We just simply put
pi over two in for

51
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,674
value of t and simplify.

52
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,220
And we end up getting
the vector negative

53
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,600
one over root two comma 0,

54
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,040
comma one over root two.

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,020
This is supposed to
have length one,

56
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,315
so it's good to
check our answers.

57
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:08,990
You can take

58
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,670
the square root
of each component

59
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,750
squared and you
can check that

60
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,060
we actually do
get one there.

61
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,745
To find the unit
normal vector,

62
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,935
we need to take
the derivative

63
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,109
of the unit tangent vector.

64
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,580
>> So we found
that, we found

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,944
a unit tangent
vector above.

66
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,194
>> We take the derivative
of each component,

67
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:27,560
and these are just
derivatives of

68
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,180
sines and cosines.

69
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,655
And we get a new vector.

70
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,455
We can calculate that

71
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,104
derivative at pi over two.

72
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:35,810
>> We can take

73
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,910
its magnitude and
that gives us

74
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,484
the unit normal vector
at pi over two.

75
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:45,809
>> But here is
0 negative 10.

76
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,610
>> So if we have the
position vector,

77
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,530
which we originally
had was cosine t,

78
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,905
sine t t in our
animation here,

79
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:55,970
that's the vector that's in

80
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,294
yellow and that's
the helix vector.

81
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,380
>> So that vector
is going to

82
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,880
indicate climbing up

83
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,000
the helix as t increases.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,715
Then for each value of t,

85
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:09,950
we have the vector
valued function for

86
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,785
the unit tangent
vector in blue.

87
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:15,095
And we have the vector
valued function

88
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,990
for the unit normal
vector that is in red.

89
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,540
>> If we're
thinking about this

90
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,490
as position

91
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,754
or movement in
three-dimensional space.

92
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:32,915
>> We have the position,

93
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:35,390
we have the velocity blue,

94
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,744
and we have the
acceleration red.

95
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,590
>> Notice that the blue and

96
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,420
the red are scaled
to have length

97
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,894
one in two-dimensional
space.

98
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,650
>> Finding the
normal vectors are

99
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,750
especially nice and easy.

100
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,100
And if you have
the unit tangent,

101
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,035
if you have the unit
tangent vector,

102
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,455
then the normal vector
is orthogonal to it.

103
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,180
And do remember that

104
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,875
if you have the
slope of a line,

105
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,350
the slope that's
perpendicular

106
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,074
to that is the
negative reciprocal.

107
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:07,309
>> Well, that's,
that's similar here.

108
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,140
>> If they couldn't
components of

109
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,660
the unit tangent
vector t1, t2,

110
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,880
you just simply flip
them and take the

111
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,260
negative of one of them and

112
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,640
then you get the
unit normal vector.

113
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:24,410
>> We can write
the acceleration

114
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,349
into components that are
orthogonal this way.

115
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,475
>> So as our projectile
moves in space,

116
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,875
you have the unit
tangent vector

117
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,885
and you have the
unit normal vector.

118
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,730
And we can decompose

119
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,275
the acceleration

120
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:42,335
into these two parts
and add them together.

121
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,510
This is useful
because the number

122
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,715
that's in front of the
unit tangent vector.

123
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,620
So it tells us how much of

124
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,410
the acceleration
contributes to the speed.

125
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,120
And the number in front of

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,355
the unit normal
vector tells us

127
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,720
how much is

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,120
contributing
perpendicular to travel.
