00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
This is a short video
on Section 13.7,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,800
triple integration with

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,395
cylindrical and
spherical coordinates.

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:09,450
For cylindrical
coordinates,

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,130
cylindrical coordinates
are a way to

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,740
describe points in
three-dimensional space.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,780
What they really
are is just

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,310
a kind of a combination of

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,260
our polar coordinates in

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,985
the x and y directions.

11
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,475
And then we just
have a comma z,

12
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:24,750
where z is just the

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,715
normal rectangular
coordinate.

14
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:28,650
That means is if
we have a point

15
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,345
x comma y comma z

16
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,385
sitting in
three-dimensional space,

17
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:34,124
it's cylindrical.

18
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:36,180
>> Cylindrical
coordinates would

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,790
be an r theta z,

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,980
where r is again, it's the,

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,030
the radius in the x,

22
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,500
y plane, which is
the square root

23
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,954
of x squared
plus y squared.

24
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:49,130
>> And then just as
polar coordinates,

25
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,230
it's angle theta is

26
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,400
found by taking the tangent

27
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,840
of theta is y over x,

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,120
and then Z is just Z as it

29
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,895
would be with
rectangular coordinates.

30
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,025
Again, we can go
back the other way.

31
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,210
If we're given a point

32
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,130
in cylindrical coordinates,

33
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,455
we can find it is a
rectangular coordinates.

34
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:08,330
Again, Z is to Z,

35
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,615
but where we can
get back x and y

36
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,160
by taking x equal to r

37
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,260
cosine theta and y
equal to r sine theta.

38
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,580
So let's describe
the surfaces

39
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,780
given in cylindrical
coordinates.

40
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,370
We have r equal to one,

41
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,020
theta equal to
pi over three,

42
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,850
and Z equal to two.

43
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,160
R equals to one is

44
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,480
just a circle of radius

45
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,919
one and the x, y plane.

46
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,290
>> But if the
z value is f3,

47
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,834
z is allowed to
be anything.

48
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,170
>> So r equals
to one gives us

49
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,255
the green cylinder here.

50
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:42,320
Theta equals two pi
over three is normally

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,690
a ray that's pointing

52
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,775
at an angle of 60 degrees.

53
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,790
Well, here, because
we have, again,

54
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,800
z is allowed to
take on any value

55
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,425
that actually gives
us a half-plane.

56
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:57,530
So starting here at the
z-axis and extending

57
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,070
60 degrees out in the,
in the x, y plane.

58
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:05,029
>> Then z equals to two.

59
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:06,500
>> Z equals to do describes

60
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,790
exactly the same plane that

61
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,350
we'll describe in
rectangular coordinates.

62
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,625
Here's the horizontal plane

63
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,230
that goes through
the 0.002.

64
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,665
>> We can do triple
integrals where

65
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:22,130
the integration of a

66
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,735
triple integral is
with respect to

67
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,939
r d z d r d theta.

68
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,770
>> And the reason for
that is very similar

69
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,630
to the same reason
we have the r d,

70
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,284
r d theta for
polar coordinates.

71
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:40,070
>> Now we just have
it also a DZ here.

72
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,615
>> We're given a solid

73
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,070
represented in
the picture here,

74
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,620
which is bounded by the
plane z equals to 0.

75
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,810
And its top is

76
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,860
the square root of

77
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,820
four minus x squared plus

78
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,170
y squared plus three.

79
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,940
And then also the cylinder

80
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,380
at x squared plus
y squared equals

81
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,170
two for the region has

82
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,680
a density function
given here.

83
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,300
And we want to be able to

84
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,920
find the mass
of this region.

85
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,640
So we can change things to

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,440
polar coordinates,
say some,

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,490
Sorry, to cylindrical
coordinates because the

88
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,650
Cylindrical coordinates
are a convenient way

89
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,720
to describe what's
going on here.

90
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,985
So in our density function,

91
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:22,220
x squared plus y squared
becomes r squared.

92
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,200
Z is just Z n plus one.

93
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,670
The region of
integration from

94
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,250
below here is the
disc of radius two.

95
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,705
And in polar coordinates,

96
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:35,479
let's just given
as r equal to two.

97
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,670
>> So that allows
us to set up our

98
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,740
integral here.

99
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,200
>> We're going to
integrate with respect to

100
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,814
z d z from z equals
to 0 to the top.

101
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:47,090
>> While the top of this is

102
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,934
defined by this
function here.

103
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:49,910
>> Here we can see

104
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,185
the limit of
integration where

105
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,550
minus x squared minus y

106
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,990
squared becomes
minus r squared.

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,660
Then d r, where r is
going to go from 0 to

108
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,850
two and theta is

109
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,664
all the way around
0 to two pi.

110
00:04:03,664 --> 00:04:05,330
>> And then this just
becomes an iterated

111
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,560
integral where we
integrate with

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,399
respect to each
variable one at a time.

113
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:14,280
>> So about 276 grams.

114
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,455
>> We also have
spherical coordinates,

115
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:19,790
just another way
of describing

116
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,934
points in
three-dimensional space.

117
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,780
>> Here, a spherical
coordinate

118
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,860
is usually used with

119
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,845
these three letters are
rho, theta and phi.

120
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:31,999
Rho is the distance
to the origin.

121
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,250
>> Okay? If phi is

122
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,255
the angle with the
positive x-axis,

123
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,250
I'm sorry, theta is

124
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,300
the angle to
the positive x.

125
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,590
>> I just noticed
that theta would be

126
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,284
the same as in
polar coordinates.

127
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,710
>> And then phi is

128
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,409
the angle from the
positive z-axis.

129
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,480
>> And every point in
three-dimensional space

130
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,520
can be described
uniquely this way.

131
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,120
>> If we have the
point given as

132
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,440
just a regular x comma y

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,585
comma z rectangular
coordinate.

134
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:00,950
We can get the spherical

135
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,859
coordinates with the
following equations.

136
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:05,570
>> You notice that row is

137
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,355
just the distance formula.

138
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,960
And then since theta is the

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,130
same as in polar
coordinates,

140
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,960
it's equation
stays the same.

141
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,040
And then the only one that

142
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
requires a little
bit more thought

143
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,404
here is how we
can find phi.

144
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,580
>> But notice
that phi here is

145
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,049
the vertical distance
from the x, y plane.

146
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,790
>> So it actually forms

147
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,560
a triangle here
with the z axis.

148
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,940
And we can do some trig to

149
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,024
see that this
is the formula.

150
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,090
>> Now,

151
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,355
given a point in
spherical coordinates,

152
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,260
we can recovers x, y,

153
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,030
and z with the
following equations.

154
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,220
>> Here's a summary of the

155
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,260
different coordinate
systems and the ways in

156
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,850
the formulas to get

157
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,875
between one and the other.

158
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,660
The main thing here is that

159
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,670
it's not trying to
complicate things,

160
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,640
but certain regions and

161
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,695
three-dimensional
space and functions

162
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,195
have different symmetries.

163
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,280
And the different
coordinate systems

164
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,740
that we might use help us.

165
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,760
I'll take advantage of

166
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,900
those similar symmetries

167
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,520
to make the
computation easier.

168
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
So he wanted to
describe the services

169
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,440
given in spherical
coordinates.

170
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,610
Here we have rho
equal to one,

171
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,900
theta is equal to
pi over three,

172
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,980
and v is equal to pi over

173
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,680
six fecal to one
or all the points

174
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,000
at distance one
from the origin.

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,530
Well, that's just
a sphere, unit

176
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,800
sphere theta equals
pi over three.

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
That's actually
identical to

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,620
the plane that we saw

179
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,915
on the cylindrical
coordinates.

180
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,820
And then here we have 5y

181
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,065
is equal to pi over six.

182
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,940
Well, those are
all the points

183
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,680
whose angle with

184
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,285
the positive z-axis is

185
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:41,790
30 degrees, that
gives us a cone.

186
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,414
>> How to buckle under
integrals are defined.

187
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:49,160
>> We have to understand
how the volume of

188
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,895
a piece with respect
to changes in rho,

189
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,935
theta and fi
would look like.

190
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,840
And here we can use

191
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,590
some trig to see that
any change in volume is

192
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,930
going to be the
change in rho times

193
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,370
rho times the change in

194
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,335
phi in this direction.

195
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:09,380
And then rho times
this row times

196
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,140
the sine of phi
times the theta.

197
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,850
And that gives us the
way to talk about how

198
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,710
volume changes with respect

199
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,360
to its spherical
coordinates,

200
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,430
with respect to
small changes

201
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,170
in rho, theta and phi.

202
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,175
Finally, we end with
the volume of a sphere.

203
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:33,620
We've seen this in
various other ways,

204
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,660
but with spherical
coordinates it's,

205
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,100
it works out in a
way where the math

206
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,989
is as easy as possible.

207
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:45,395
>> So here, if we have
a sphere of radius r,

208
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:49,565
we can integrate
rho from 0 to r,

209
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:51,980
then integrate theta
from 0 to two pi and

210
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,574
integrate v from 0 to pi.

211
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,150
>> And if we do

212
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,950
this integration with
as iterated integral,

213
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,425
we didn't exactly four
pi over three R cubed,

214
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:01,850
which is what
we know as the

215
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,170
volume of a sphere.
