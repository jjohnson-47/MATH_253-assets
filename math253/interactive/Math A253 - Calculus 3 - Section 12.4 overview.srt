1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Let's look at a short
overview of section

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,750
12.4 on

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,850
differentiability and
the total derivative.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,680
Recall from calculus
one that a differential

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,970
is an expression
that helps us

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,595
discuss small changes
in a variable.

7
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,025
We saw that if y is f of x,

8
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:20,505
we can write d y is
f prime of x, dx.

9
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:23,460
And then we interpret
dx as a small change in

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,890
x and d y

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,349
as the corresponding
small change in y.

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,670
>> For small changes in x.

13
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:33,720
>> The same kind of
situation is true

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,740
for functions of
two variables,

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,760
but now we have
a new function,

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,635
a new variable z,

17
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:44,010
that changes with small
changes and x and y.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,655
And we find the
total differential

19
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,760
by adding up
these two parts.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,770
So let's find the two, the

21
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,019
total differentiable
dysfunction.

22
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,600
>> We can find the
partial derivatives

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,939
with respect to x
and respect to y.

24
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,260
>> And then it's
just a matter

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,400
of simply writing down

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,590
those partial
derivatives attached to

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,380
the corresponding
differentials dx and dy y.

28
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:12,935
>> What is DZ?
Anyways? Remember that

29
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:15,710
we really want
to know if a,

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,365
if x and y change
a little bit,

31
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:22,115
how much does d, how
much does z change?

32
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,070
Well, d z tells
us how much it

33
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,900
changes if the function

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,329
is perfectly flat
at that point.

35
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,535
>> So it's like a
linear estimate

36
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:34,549
of what the change
in x and y s.

37
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,220
>> So we want to use DZ

38
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,720
to estimate changes in Z.

39
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,120
Just to be clear,
the actual change

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,155
in the z value we usually
write as delta z,

41
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:52,655
but we want to estimate
delta z with TZ,

42
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,529
which is the
estimated change.

43
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,850
>> Using the total
differential,

44
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,854
we can write the actual
change delta z as DZ.

45
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:06,500
>> There's sort of

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,795
a local approximated change

47
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:14,105
plus some error in the
x and y directions.

48
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:16,850
So a function is
differentiable

49
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,675
is as DX and DY
get really small.

50
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,700
Also, these
errors get really

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,590
small and the technical
description is here.

52
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,110
But that's essentially
what's happening is

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,790
that the function
can be a locally

54
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,050
approximated by

55
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,175
a tangent plane
by flat surface.

56
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:39,305
And that flat
surface means that

57
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:43,530
DZ is a good approximation
for delta Z.

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,070
We want to keep
the logic of

59
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,145
continuity and
differentiability straight.

60
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:53,840
And we want to
remember that if

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
a function is
differentiable,

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,230
then it indeed has
to be continuous,

63
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,814
but it's not true the
other way around.

64
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:05,779
>> A function
is continuous.

65
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,775
>> It may not be
differentiable.

66
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:11,750
A function can have
jagged parts on

67
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,370
the surface where
the derivative

68
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,920
doesn't exist but
still be continuous,

69
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
we can show that

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,790
something is
differentiable, however,

71
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,580
by looking at the
partial derivatives

72
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,200
and showing that
they are continuous.

73
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,420
>> So let's find, let's use

74
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,149
the differential to
make an approximation.

75
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,980
>> So here we're given
a function z equals

76
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,080
the square root of
x times sine of y.

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,060
And we want to
approximate at

78
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,645
the function at four
comma one comma 0.8.

79
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:46,625
Now 4.10.8 aren't
particularly nice numbers,

80
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,620
but they are very
close to the

81
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,729
0.4 comma pi over four.

82
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:55,685
>> And if we had four
comma pi over four,

83
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,770
that's actually
an easy point

84
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,185
to evaluate a dysfunction.

85
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,930
So we would like
to, since we can

86
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,765
find the functions value
at a nearby point,

87
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,280
we would like to use

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,870
the differential to find

89
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,040
with that change must

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,525
be in the function

91
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:16,170
between four pi
over 44.10.8.

92
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,070
>> Okay? So we can find

93
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,465
the differential

94
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:25,190
by taking the
partial derivatives

95
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,080
of the function here.

96
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,864
>> We can find the
partial derivatives

97
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,994
with respect to x
and respect to y.

98
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,080
>> And then we
evaluate at the point

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,750
that we can easily find,

100
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,969
which is four comma
pi over four.

101
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,860
>> And that gives us
these values here.

102
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,300
And then we have the
changes in the function.

103
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
We know that to go
from four to 4.1,

104
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,870
we have a delta of 0.10.8

105
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,110
pi over four is about 0.05.

106
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,570
Therefore, the
approximate value

107
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,010
of the function is

108
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,990
the functions value at

109
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,690
the nearby point plus
this small change.

110
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,940
In the small change
we're measuring with

111
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,740
the total
differential that we

112
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,350
found above at this point.

113
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,470
So we get our estimation
to be about 1.4531
