1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
Let's take a look at

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,150
line integrals over
vector fields.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,475
In section 14.3.

4
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:07,530
We'll start by looking at

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,820
work in vector fields as

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,890
a motivation for the model

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,305
of line integrals
in vector fields.

8
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,390
If we have a vector field

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,190
and a curve inside of it,

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,900
it's natural to
think about how much

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,340
work is the vector field

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,050
doing for a particle to

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,780
move along that curve?

14
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,210
Strategy is to take
a look a small

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,580
piece along the curve
that's going to be

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,355
the distance and
the direction

17
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,950
with the unit tangent
t. Unit tangent T.

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,240
And then remember that work

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,665
is the dot product of

20
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:39,255
the force applied with

21
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:41,875
the direction that
the work is done.

22
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,700
So the direction
the work is

23
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,100
done here is the
unit tangent T,

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,340
and the distance
is delta s. And

25
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,450
the force being
applied to at

26
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,740
any particular point comes

27
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,150
from the vector field.

28
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,695
So to find the
work, we find

29
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,940
the work in each smaller
and smaller piece.

30
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,620
And then we sum

31
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,210
that all up with
a, an integral.

32
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,800
And since the work

33
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,675
is being done
over the curve C,

34
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:10,010
we're going to
integrate over c. Okay?

35
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,450
Then if we have a
parametrization

36
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,400
of the curve r,

37
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,460
we can find these two
values in terms of

38
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,110
the parametrization
and update

39
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,475
our, our work integral.

40
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:21,350
And we see that
the work integral

41
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,090
really is just the line

42
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,900
integral of the vector
field over the curve.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,160
So this gives us a
handy way to find

44
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,830
work of a line integral
in a vector field.

45
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,140
We just parameterize
the curve,

46
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,260
put the curve into the
vector field function,

47
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,940
find the derivative of

48
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,140
the parameterization and

49
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,330
calculate the
corresponding integral.

50
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,580
For properties
of, properties

51
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,250
of line integrals
over vector fields.

52
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,140
The first two are
very, very familiar.

53
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,250
We can pull out constants

54
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,825
and some the functions.

55
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,330
The last one
says that if we

56
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,510
parameterize
the curve in a,

57
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,245
in a vector field and
find its work integral,

58
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:08,810
It's going to be the
opposite or the negative

59
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,030
of if we parameterize
it the other way.

60
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,835
So let's look at
this vector field

61
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,575
defined capital F here.

62
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:21,140
And the path c
that starts at

63
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,910
the origin goes along

64
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,830
the blue curve to
the 0.1 comma one,

65
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,240
and then goes back
to the origin

66
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,620
along a straight line.

67
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,180
And we want to find what's

68
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,190
the total work
that's done by

69
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,900
the vector field
as a particle

70
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,900
moves along that path.

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,630
Since the path,
which we'll call c1,

72
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,970
the blue NC2,

73
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,190
do not have a
smooth connection.

74
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,869
Here we have to separate

75
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:48,005
the curve c into two
pieces, c1 and c2.

76
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,450
We can parameterize
C1 and C2.

77
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,420
So C1 is just
parameterized by t,

78
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,595
t cubed as t goes
from 0 to one,

79
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,410
and c2 is
parameterized by t,

80
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,870
t. Note that the
parametrization for c2

81
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,265
here that we've given

82
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,680
actually starts
at 0 comma 0,

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,110
and then moves to
one comma one.

84
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,555
So it's going in the
opposite direction

85
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,060
that we want C2 to move in.

86
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,940
That's okay, because
all we have to

87
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,835
do is negate the
line integral.

88
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:17,930
And that will give us

89
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,670
the orientation
that we want.

90
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,530
So this gives
us some freedom

91
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,880
to define a sort of

92
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,610
easier parameterization
and then

93
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,810
allows us to just flip

94
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,765
the orientation by
negating the integral.

95
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,730
The total work being

96
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,830
done over the
entire curve is

97
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,780
just the difference here of

98
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,570
the line integral of the
vector field over c,

99
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,150
one minus of the
vector field over C2.

100
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,715
So we do is we put our
parameterizations,

101
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:48,890
R1 into f and R2 into

102
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,780
f. Here we take
the derivative of

103
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,910
the parameterizations
that gives

104
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,680
us a dot product
of two vectors in

105
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,810
terms of the
variable t. And we

106
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,860
get some nice polynomial

107
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,405
functions to integrate.

108
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,860
And we get that
the total work

109
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,940
is negative three-fourths.

110
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,210
To do more with
line integrals,

111
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,740
we need to understand

112
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,525
a little bit more of the,

113
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,790
how sets are, are built in

114
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,110
different properties
or different kinds of

115
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,820
sets in two
dimensional space.

116
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,725
In three-dimensional space,

117
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:17,990
we can see that
what we mean by

118
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,830
connected is that a
connected set is that any

119
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,870
two points that we can find

120
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,010
a path from one to the

121
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,615
other that stays
inside the set.

122
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:27,800
We can see that for the two

123
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,180
dimensional example
here on the left,

124
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,010
these, this set
is not connected.

125
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,760
You can get from

126
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,260
the left piece to
the right piece.

127
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,420
Same with a2 surfaces

128
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,775
here in
three-dimensional space,

129
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,830
the two in the middle are

130
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,700
connected from any point
to any other point,

131
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,170
we can find a
path that remains

132
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,490
inside the set.

133
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,900
The same with the
doughnut here,

134
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,235
often called the tourists.

135
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:52,910
But they can, if
you can't retract

136
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,360
the path without passing

137
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,445
through a part that
is not in the set.

138
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:00,860
So if you think of
it like a string,

139
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,755
if you start at a point
and you loop back,

140
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,840
you can create
a loop where if

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
you try to deform that
string to a point,

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,730
that loop would pass
through parts of

143
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,910
the past to things that
are not in the set.

144
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,920
So this is just a
way of describing

145
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,560
holes in some
sense an estimate.

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,300
It's not simply connected.

147
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,140
The donuts not simply
connected because any,

148
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,434
any loop that goes along

149
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,525
these holes around
the outside

150
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,950
can't be retracted without

151
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,465
passing through the hole.

152
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,460
And then we see two simply

153
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,575
connected sets
on the right,

154
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:38,720
the just plain region here.

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
And then we have
a globe with

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,960
our piece missing
on the inside.

157
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,005
Any loop inside can be
deformed to appoint,

158
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,790
even, even with the
hollow part missing.

159
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,055
If we have a vector field

160
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:57,260
who comes from a
potential function,

161
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,685
which we'll describe
in a minute.

162
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,870
We call conservative.

163
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,190
And this is the
definition of

164
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,645
a conservative
vector field.

165
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,430
A conservative
vector field is

166
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,635
a vector field
where if you have

167
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:08,480
any path in

168
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,970
the vector field
between two points,

169
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,190
that the work
integral remains the

170
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,345
same no matter what
path that you choose.

171
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:18,995
So you start at point a,

172
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:21,230
you end at point
B in you go

173
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,360
from point a to point
B along one path,

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,530
you calculate the end,

175
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,360
the work integral
and you get a value.

176
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,580
And it's a conservative
vector field

177
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,980
if any other path

178
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,185
gives you that
exact same value.

179
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,005
This property is called
path independence,

180
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,520
and it's pretty
important in physics.

181
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,010
There's an important
theorem that says that

182
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,725
the work integral census
path independent.

183
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,765
If we have a function

184
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:51,980
whose gradient is

185
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,990
the vector field,
that grid, that,

186
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,030
that function is called
a potential function,

187
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,490
actually acts like
an antiderivative

188
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,365
in the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

189
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:01,790
So the work integral

190
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,335
is very easy to calculate.

191
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,850
You find the
potential function

192
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,545
whose gradient is
the vector field.

193
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,120
And then just evaluate at

194
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,650
the two points and
take the difference.

195
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,715
Let's take a look
at an example.

196
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,620
So here we have the
following vector field

197
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,930
and points a and B.

198
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,505
We want to show that

199
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,485
this vector fields

200
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,070
a conservative
vector field.

201
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,480
And then we'll
calculate the

202
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,875
work from a to B,

203
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,235
Hopefully easily using
path independence

204
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:30,290
to show that it's

205
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,370
a conservative
vector field.

206
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,154
We're trying to
find a function

207
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,300
whose gradient is F.
So we're trying to

208
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,960
find a function

209
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,415
whose partial derivative
with respect to

210
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,460
x is 3x squared y plus 2x.

211
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,750
And whose partial
derivative with respect to

212
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,835
y is x cubed plus one.

213
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,024
So we can do is integrate

214
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,330
the left hand function

215
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,680
here with respect to x,

216
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,985
integrate the right hand

217
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,965
function with respect to y.

218
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,930
And that will
produce hopefully

219
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,700
a function whose derivative

220
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,040
with respect to x is this

221
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
on the left and
whose derivative is

222
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,280
like the wisest
one on the right.

223
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,380
So we go through
that process.

224
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,205
But remember when we

225
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:06,605
integrate with
respect to x,

226
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:07,940
the constant of integration

227
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,440
could be any function of y,

228
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,670
because when we take

229
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,900
the derivative
with respect to x,

230
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,940
y is considered a constant.

231
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,980
So you integrate
with respect to x,

232
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,495
you integrate with
respect to y,

233
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,905
and we get these two

234
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,925
constants of integration.

235
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,260
But we know that
these two functions

236
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,985
must be the same.

237
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:27,055
So by saying them equal,

238
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,990
that gives us a clear
choice for what to

239
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,060
choose for the constant

240
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,380
of integration with
respect to y and

241
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,140
the constant
integration of x here.

242
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,520
If we choose the
constant mitigation

243
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,155
director y to just be Y,

244
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:39,280
then that will match up

245
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,240
with the right hand side.

246
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,720
If we choose the

247
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,815
constant here with
wrecked acts,

248
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,030
make it be x squared,
it'll matter.

249
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,740
But the left hand
side, and that gives

250
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,230
us a function with the
desired properties.

251
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,540
So that's a
potential function

252
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,755
for the vector field.

253
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:52,090
We've engineered it, so

254
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,965
its gradient is
the vector field.

255
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,660
We know that path
independence

256
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,955
holds based on the
previous theorem.

257
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,530
So if we want to
find the work

258
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,525
done from point
a to point B,

259
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,790
we simply evaluate
the end points,

260
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,890
in this case 011, for

261
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,470
at the end points of
our potential function.

262
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,930
To find the work done
much easier than

263
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,700
parameterizing
the curve and

264
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,170
using the formulas
we saw earlier.

265
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,060
Another way to test
whether a vector field is

266
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,025
a conservative
field is that

267
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:25,890
its curl is 0
throughout the field.
