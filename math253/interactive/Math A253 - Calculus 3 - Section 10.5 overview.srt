1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Let's take a look at lines

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,224
in three-dimensional space.

3
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:04,500
>> This is an
overview of section

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,674
10.5 and our text.

5
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,640
>> The best way to
understand lines in

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,770
three-dimensional
space is to re,

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,184
understand lines in
two-dimensional space.

8
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:14,999
>> This is a familiar
equation here.

9
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,080
>> Y is equal
to negative two

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,549
thirds x plus four.

11
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:20,009
>> The graph of the
line is given here.

12
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,530
>> And the main thing
to remember is that

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,300
this equation gives us

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,159
two pieces of information
about the line.

15
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,320
>> It gives us
a slope, which

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,659
we can interpret as a
direction of the line.

17
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:32,610
>> And it gives us a point,

18
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,320
which is some
point on the line,

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,150
in this case, 0 comma four,

20
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,199
which is the y-intercept.

21
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,040
>> We can reinterpret
that information

22
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,540
as a direction vector.

23
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,520
Remember, the slope
is the change

24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,050
in y over the change of x.

25
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,430
So we can put that
information into

26
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,240
a vector D as three
comma negative two.

27
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
And that gives us

28
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,570
the green arrow
that you see here.

29
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,240
And then we have a
starting position,

30
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,685
which we see as
the blue arrow.

31
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:05,600
And that allows us to
write an equation of

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,035
a vector that changes

33
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,290
as t moves t as a
parameter, a real number.

34
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,670
And as t increases,
they starting vector,

35
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,100
the blue arrow, changes

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,250
in the direction of
the direction vector.

37
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,454
Now this is a new
kind of function.

38
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:25,160
>> This is a function

39
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,735
whose output is
not a real number,

40
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,809
but whose output
is a vector.

41
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:33,510
>> This is the vector
equation of the line.

42
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,740
So this gives rise to

43
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,634
three new types of
equations for a line.

44
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,270
>> So we have a
vector equation,

45
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,679
which we just saw.

46
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:44,930
>> And if the
vector equation

47
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,410
describes a
vector x comma y,

48
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,080
then we can equate
the components.

49
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,394
>> Here.

50
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,455
>> X is equal to 0 plus 3t,

51
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,929
which tells us
the exposition.

52
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,925
>> For any value of
the parameter t,

53
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:01,625
y is equal to
four minus 2T,

54
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,200
which tells us the y

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,730
position for
every parameter

56
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,470
t. These two equations

57
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,550
together are called the

58
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,394
parametric equations
of a line.

59
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,015
>> As t varies,

60
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,410
it describes a different x

61
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,404
comma y point on the line.

62
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:16,220
>> In both of these,
you can solve for

63
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,400
t. And since t is
the same bolt,

64
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
set those equal
to each other.

65
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,230
>> And that gives us

66
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,850
the symmetric equation
for the line.

67
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,640
So this gives us

68
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,184
three new equations
for the line.

69
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:28,130
>> All of them give

70
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,929
us this important
information.

71
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,060
>> One of them
is the original

72
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,445
position on the line,

73
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,499
in this case, 0 comma four.

74
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,450
>> And all of them,
all of them give us

75
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,070
the direction which we

76
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,094
normally think
of as the slope.

77
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,030
>> In the symmetric
equations,

78
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,514
you can solve for y.

79
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:46,760
>> And you actually,
you get up, you

80
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,110
get exactly what
we started with.

81
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:51,889
>> Minds in
three-dimensions

82
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,450
are pretty much the same,

83
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,399
except we have
three coordinates.

84
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,780
>> You have a
starting, starting

85
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,119
position and you have
a direction vector.

86
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,505
>> If you equate the
three components,

87
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:04,699
you get the three
parametric equations.

88
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,050
>> And if you solve for t

89
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,489
in the parametric equations

90
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,930
and then set those
equal to each other,

91
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,549
you get the
symmetric equations

92
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,940
Important thing to remember

93
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,855
is all of them have

94
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,060
a position and a direction.

95
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,630
>> Let's find the
parameter equations

96
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,010
of a line through
the points two

97
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,940
negative 12 and the
0.13 negative one.

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm gonna take an
initial position

99
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,815
vector as two,

100
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:33,829
negative 12 as given.

101
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,525
>> And then for
a direction,

102
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:38,495
I'll just take the
vector from P to Q.

103
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,220
We can find that
vector to be

104
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,660
negative 14,
negative three.

105
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,260
I always like once we have

106
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,825
the starting vector
and a direction,

107
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,255
I always write down
the vector equation

108
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:51,814
just because it's
handy to have.

109
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,660
>> It has the starting
position and then

110
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,390
the direction
vector right there,

111
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,830
where we can skip straight

112
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,435
to the parametric
equations,

113
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:00,740
which are written
like this,

114
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,240
with the starting
position values

115
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,634
x-naught, y-naught,
z naught.

116
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,895
>> And this started in the

117
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,399
direction vector
components a, B, and C.

118
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,320
>> So there we have
the parametric

119
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,150
equations for this line.

120
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,925
Lines in three-dimensional
space can

121
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,114
be situated in any
of these four ways.

122
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:18,424
>> They can intersect at 1,

123
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,080
they can intersect
at all points,

124
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,580
which means that
the same line,

125
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,800
they can point in
the same direction

126
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,615
but not intersect.

127
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:32,015
And that means the two
lines are parallel

128
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,470
or they can
non-intersecting

129
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,430
point in different
directions,

130
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,780
which means the two
lines are skew.

131
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,950
>> Consider the two lines

132
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,060
given here and parametric

133
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,160
equations determine
whether the

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,500
same they are the same
line they intersect,

135
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,780
are parallel or skew.

136
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,810
To determine if the
lines are parallel,

137
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,530
we just have to

138
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,134
compare the
direction vectors.

139
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,460
>> And the direction
vectors are given as

140
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,780
the coefficients
in front of

141
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,164
the parameter t and
s respectively.

142
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,875
>> So the direction vector

143
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,720
of the line one is three,

144
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,850
negative 11, and the
direction vector

145
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,594
of line two is 412.

146
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:09,085
>> If we can see that

147
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:12,250
these two vectors are
not parallel sends,

148
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,140
one can be written as
a constant multiple

149
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,090
of the other just
by looking at,

150
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,425
because the numbers
are kinda nice.

151
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:19,770
But in general, the
numbers may not be nice.

152
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,560
It may be hard to tell if

153
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,760
one vector can
be written as

154
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,559
a constant multiple
of the other.

155
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,140
>> So the procedure
is to set

156
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,100
one vector equal to

157
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,019
a constant times the other.

158
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:31,610
>> That gives you,
in this case,

159
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,504
three separate equations
with C involved.

160
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,290
>> But this shows
that C is equal to

161
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,090
three fourths and c is
equal to negative one,

162
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,379
which can't both be true.

163
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,670
>> So there is no such.

164
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,140
>> See the vectors are not

165
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,655
constant multiples
of each other

166
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,870
and they are not parallel.

167
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,515
Since the lines
aren't parallel,

168
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,940
they must be either
intersecting or

169
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,874
skew to determine if
they're intersecting.

170
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:57,080
>> We notice
that if there is

171
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,375
a point where they
both have in common,

172
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,620
then there must
be a value for

173
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,790
t and there must be a value

174
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,265
for S that have
the same x value,

175
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:07,009
the same y value, and
the same z value.

176
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,080
>> So if we set the
three equations

177
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,775
equal to, equal
to each other,

178
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,920
that just gives us a system

179
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
of linear equations
to solve,

180
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,999
very much like our
previous algebra class.

181
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,680
>> What I did here is I

182
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,730
just added the second,

183
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,140
third equations
to eliminate

184
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,340
the T. And it turns

185
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,540
out that as has to be

186
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,400
negative two and
t has to be one.

187
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,660
But if you put
that back into

188
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,089
the top equation, you
get a contradiction.

189
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,830
>> So that means these
two lines do not

190
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,960
intersect, so it
must be skew.

191
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,770
>> Something else we
need to be able to

192
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,600
do is to find the
distance from a point

193
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,260
to a line given a point
q not on the line,

194
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,330
in some line with

195
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,834
position p in
direction vector D.

196
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,660
>> You have a picture that

197
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,565
looks kinda like this.

198
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,770
In a handy way to remember

199
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,110
this formula is to remember

200
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,690
that the magnitude of

201
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,710
the cross-product is

202
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,285
the area of the
parallelogram.

203
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,115
So if you take a look
at this picture,

204
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:04,820
we have a vector PQ and
we have a vector d,

205
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,110
the direction
vector on the line.

206
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,860
What we really want
is the distance

207
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,630
from point q to the line.

208
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,430
That's the height of

209
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,320
the parallelogram that
you get when you are

210
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,670
that's formed by pq and

211
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,330
D. So we can
find the area of

212
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,620
the parallelogram by taking

213
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,360
the cross product
and divide

214
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,474
by the base to
get the height.

215
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:25,825
>> So it's really just area

216
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,174
equals base times height.

217
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:28,510
>> But in this
case we're solving

218
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,249
for the height of
the parallelogram.

219
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,360
>> And that's a handy way

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,470
to remember this formula.

221
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,840
>> The distance
between two lines,

222
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,430
if the two lines intersect,

223
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,630
the distance is 0.

224
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,220
If the two lines
are parallel,

225
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,420
you could just
take a point on

226
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,710
one of the lines
and then use

227
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,465
the previous slide to find

228
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,560
the distance from that

229
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,730
point to the other line.

230
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,900
>> Now the situation's
more interesting.

231
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,865
>> If you have
to skew lines.

232
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,295
If you have to skew lines,

233
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,900
what you do is you
take a point on

234
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,210
each line and then you
take the projection

235
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,035
of that vector form
from 1 to the other

236
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:08,420
on to a vector that's in

237
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,580
the direction
that's orthogonal

238
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,229
to both of the lines.

239
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,225
>> It takes a little
bit of thinking to

240
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:16,235
convince yourself that
that actually works.

241
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:18,500
But the shortest
distance between

242
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,570
these two skew
lines is exactly

243
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,330
the place where the vector

244
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,404
that's orthogonal
to both directions.

245
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,460
>> So we can find
the vector that's

246
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,990
orthogonal to both
directions by

247
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,820
finding the directions of

248
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,620
both lines, D1 and D2.

249
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,989
>> Taking the
cross-product gives us C.

250
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,790
>> And then you can
use this formula

251
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,489
here to calculate
the distance.

252
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,680
>> So let's find the
distance between

253
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,640
the two lines
that we looked

254
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,660
at in the previous example.

255
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,140
>> First thing
you need to do

256
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,160
to find the
distance between

257
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,720
two lines is determine

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,904
what kind of
lines are they?

259
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,045
>> Are they intersecting

260
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,379
or are they parallel?

261
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,820
>> In this case,
we already found

262
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,350
these two lines to be skew.

263
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,760
So we have to
use the formula

264
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,860
for the distance
between skew lines.

265
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,905
>> So first we identify
a point on each line,

266
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,540
and then we identify that

267
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,950
the direction vectors of

268
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,335
each line, which
can be found here.

269
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,800
A point on the first
line is one to 0.

270
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,379
On the second line
is negative 235.

271
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:19,610
>> The direction vector of

272
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,690
the first line is three,

273
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,970
negative 11, and the
direction vector

274
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,890
of the second line is 412.

275
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,290
>> Then we can find
the vector P1, P2.

276
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,140
We can find the vector C,

277
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,124
which is the cross-product
of D1 and D2.

278
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,300
>> It's good
practice for finding

279
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,530
cross-products,
the two vectors.

280
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,400
>> The dot
product of P1, P2

281
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,604
with C gives us 42,

282
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,450
the magnitude of
the vector c,

283
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,130
because a squared
is 62, and

284
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,180
therefore the
distance between

285
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,740
these two skew lines is

286
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,350
42 divided by the
square root of 62.
