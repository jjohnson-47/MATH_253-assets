1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Let's take a look at

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,149
double integration with
polar coordinates.

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,239
>> Doesn't overview
of Section 13.3.

4
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,340
>> To talk about
double integrals

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,540
in polar coordinates,

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,210
we need to construct
the integral,

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,740
the double integral, in

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,544
terms of polar
coordinate regions.

9
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:18,840
>> In order to do that,
we need to understand

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,150
what is the area of

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,370
a rect and for
rectangular region

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,964
subdivided into
polar rectangles.

13
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,740
Now polar rectangle
is a rectangle that's

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,990
bounded by two
different R values

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,370
and two different
theta values.

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,450
We can try to
find the area of

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,220
one of these pieces
by just using

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,565
some basic geometry where

19
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:41,930
we have the proportion of

20
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,355
all the way around
the circle,

21
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:45,380
which is the delta theta is

22
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,779
the angle here
divided by two pi.

23
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:50,644
>> So that's the
proportion of the circle.

24
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:52,100
>> And then we have the

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,095
circle with the radius R2,

26
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,795
R2, R2 squared pi,

27
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,910
and then the circle with
the smaller radius,

28
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,560
R1 squared pi,

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,870
the area that actually

30
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,610
this formula
describes the area

31
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,485
of this piece
of the sector.

32
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:09,635
Now we can simplify a
bit, cancel the pies,

33
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,870
and then write
the difference

34
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,284
of squares and factor it.

35
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,895
>> And what we see
is when we let

36
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:19,940
R one and R2
become very close,

37
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,969
and we let delta
theta becomes 0.

38
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,805
>> We can use some
notation here to write

39
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:29,285
delta r is the difference
between R1 and R2.

40
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:31,490
And then R1 plus
R2 over two is

41
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,325
just the average of
these two values.

42
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,740
So we get a
convenient formula

43
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,100
for how the change of
the area of one of

44
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,085
these little
rectangles behaves

45
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:46,535
as our changes and
delta changes,

46
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,845
I'm sorry, theta changes.

47
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:51,860
So now we're going to
take the limit and

48
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,790
then we actually get

49
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,230
this convenient formula for

50
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,970
the differentials that tell

51
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,440
us how to approximate

52
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,580
change in area for

53
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,910
small nudges in the
radius and the angle.

54
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,715
Note here that how to,

55
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:06,695
when we write the
iterated integral,

56
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:09,320
it's not just the
function with x

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,400
and y replaced with r

58
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,005
cosine theta, r sine theta.

59
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:15,570
But we also have
an r d r d theta.

60
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,770
So let's use this technique

61
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,520
to find the volume

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,820
underneath the plane
over the unit disk.

63
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,620
So in this plane,
I'm sorry,

64
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,670
in this example,
we're going to

65
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,130
find the volume
over the unit disc.

66
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,635
And the unit disk is
just defined as the,

67
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:34,180
the points where
x squared plus

68
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,145
y squared is less
than or equal to one.

69
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,860
And then we can write
the double integral in

70
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,810
its general form of

71
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,950
the function that describes

72
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,270
the plane over
the region R.

73
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,140
Now to write it as an

74
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,760
integral in polar
coordinates,

75
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,380
we want to make
the appropriate

76
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,570
substitutions where x is r,

77
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,160
cosine theta y is r,

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,510
sine theta r goes

79
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,405
from 0 to one and
the unit disc.

80
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,590
And then we're going all

81
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,535
the way around the circle.

82
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,785
Theta goes from
0 to two pi.

83
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,870
Now we have an
iterated integral,

84
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,590
two variables and we

85
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,850
can compute it like usual.

86
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,390
So here we fact we
multiply through by r,

87
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,970
find the derivative
with respect

88
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,080
the antiderivative
with respect

89
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,265
to r of the inside,

90
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:24,440
evaluate at the end points.

91
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,570
And now we just
have a regular

92
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,760
integral with
respect to theta.

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,579
And we get our
answer is four pi.

94
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,109
>> And what are
we finding here?

95
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,420
>> We are finding the
volume underneath

96
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,765
the surface of the plane
above the unit disk.

97
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:42,840
So it's this piece
underneath the plane here.
