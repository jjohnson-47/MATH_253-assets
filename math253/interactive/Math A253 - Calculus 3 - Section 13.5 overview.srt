1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
Let's take a look at

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,600
surface area and
Section 13.5.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,244
We'll start by estimating

4
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:08,610
a small little piece of

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,010
surface area by subdividing

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,200
the region underneath
the function

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,450
of two variables
and then finding

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,500
the area of

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,135
the associated

10
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,520
small rectangle
in the surface.

11
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:26,819
>> So we have a
small rectangle

12
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,559
in the domain of
the function.

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,050
>> And we see we have
these two vectors

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,880
that point in you in

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,490
the direction of the
positive x direction

16
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,055
and v in the positive
y direction.

17
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:41,629
And if we could find
those two vectors,

18
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,220
we could estimate the area

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,795
of that small rectangle

20
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,270
with the magnitude of

21
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,310
the cross-product of
those two vectors.

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,010
So first we want to
find those two vectors.

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,620
Well, u is in
the direction of

24
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,955
the positive x-axis
and it's direct.

25
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,070
Its length in the
positive x direction

26
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,660
is delta x i.

27
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,910
In this case envies

28
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,570
length in the y
direction is delta y i.

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,595
And the vector u changes
with respect to the,

30
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:14,630
how the function is

31
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,830
changing in the
X direction.

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,405
And that's the derivative
with respect x.

33
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:19,850
And the function in the
vector v changes in

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,500
the z direction as

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,910
f changes in the
y direction.

36
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,960
And that's the derivative

37
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,294
of f with respect to y.

38
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,890
>> So this actually
tells us what

39
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,500
the vectors u
and v must be.

40
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,839
>> So now we can
write our derivation.

41
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:38,885
>> The small piece
of surface area here

42
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:40,820
is approximated
by the area of

43
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,174
the rectangle
formed by u and v.

44
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:44,060
>> But the area of

45
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,620
the rectangle
formed by U and V

46
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,340
is the magnitude of

47
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,514
the cross-product of
those two vectors.

48
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:52,790
>> But the two vectors
are as given here.

49
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,950
And if we find the
cross product,

50
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,555
we get this nice formula

51
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:57,830
with the square root of one

52
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,270
plus the sum of

53
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,890
the squares of the
partial derivatives.

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,165
>> So the total
surface area

55
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:09,160
is actually approximated by

56
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,110
the sum over all of

57
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,419
these small little squares,

58
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,210
small little rectangles of

59
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,074
these approximations
that we found above.

60
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,640
>> So the key
here is to let

61
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,020
the small rectangles gets

62
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,465
smaller and smaller
and smaller.

63
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:28,510
And if we let the
limit go to 0,

64
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,720
we get that a small
change in surface area is

65
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,690
approximated by
this differential

66
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,819
here with a small
change in the area.

67
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,380
>> And that allows
us to define an

68
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,960
integral to tell us
what the surface areas.

69
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,530
>> So let's take a look at

70
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,060
the surface of a sphere.

71
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,410
We can find the surface

72
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,490
of a sphere by just looking

73
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,450
at the top half of

74
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,025
it and then
we'll double it.

75
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:55,040
But the equation for the
top half of a sphere

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,700
of radius a is given
with this function,

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,500
we can find its
partial derivatives.

78
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,370
>> So then the surface area

79
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,570
by integral formula

80
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,720
is just two times
the integral,

81
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,134
the double integral
over the region R.

82
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:16,280
>> In this case,
the region R is

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,669
the disk of radius
a centered at 00.

84
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,940
>> And if we substitute

85
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,290
in our partial derivatives,

86
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,970
we get the
following integral.

87
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,970
Now we just covered

88
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,590
integration of
polar coordinates,

89
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,460
and we should
see that that's

90
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,660
a good thing to use

91
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,190
here because we have

92
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,510
x squared plus y squared,

93
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,859
which we know is r-squared.

94
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,405
>> And hopefully
that will give us

95
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:40,460
a simpler expression to

96
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,304
write as an
iterated integral.

97
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,510
>> And indeed we do so.

98
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,310
>> If we write x and y,

99
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,690
x is r cosine theta,

100
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,770
y is r sine theta.

101
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,195
>> And make our
substitutions,

102
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,380
we get the
following integral,

103
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,000
which doesn't look nicer,

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,710
but it does simplify down.

105
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,380
Now here we'll
notice that we do

106
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,790
have an improper integrals.

107
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,725
>> So we do have to
worry about the limit

108
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:06,305
as R approaches a,

109
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:09,635
because then the
bottom here is 0.

110
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:13,085
But if we're careful
with the limits and we,

111
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,275
and we do our substitution

112
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:18,814
where u is a squared
minus r squared.

113
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:21,679
>> We end up with a
simpler integral here.

114
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,080
>> And we get that
the surface area of

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,020
the sphere is four
pi a squared,

116
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,824
which is what we knew
it was from earlier.

117
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,620
>> Geometry
