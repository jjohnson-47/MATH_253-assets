00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
Hello. Let's take a look at

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,495
the calculus of motion.

3
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:04,710
This is an overview
of Section

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,320
11.3 when you talk

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,300
about velocity, speed
and acceleration.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,290
We've already been
using this language

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,640
in the previous video,

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,530
but if we think of
our vector valued

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,140
function r as position,

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,020
then its derivative
is given by

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,280
velocity or

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,665
the instantaneous
rate of the position.

13
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:29,840
The magnitude
of the velocity

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,985
is what we think
of as speed.

15
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:36,120
Andy, acceleration is
the second derivative.

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,770
Here's an example
where we have

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,450
a young boy whirling
a ball attached to

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,800
a string above his head

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,125
in a counterclockwise way.

20
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,820
In this example, the,

21
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,440
it's making one revolution

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,824
every two pi seconds.

23
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,970
>> And this string has
a length of two feet.

24
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,965
So you should notice
immediately that this is

25
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:57,530
pretty much impossible
on our planet.

26
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,845
>> Two pi seconds
is too long

27
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:02,960
for us to go

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,210
around for with a
length of two feet.

29
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,605
But it makes the math

30
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,375
easier for this problem.

31
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,565
And so the math
will be the same

32
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:12,800
if the rotated faster.

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,030
It would just change

34
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,379
the equations a little bit.

35
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:19,190
>> But let's play
along. First, let's

36
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,960
find the position
vector that

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,240
describes a situation
while the ball

38
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,349
is spinning around
counterclockwise.

39
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,090
>> So that's given
by the vector

40
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,220
valued function cosine t,

41
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,115
sine t, but the
radius is two,

42
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,230
so we multiply two
in each component.

43
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,040
Then the velocity
of the ball then

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,125
is the derivative
of that position.

45
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,285
So you take the derivative
of each component

46
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,054
and you get the
velocity vector.

47
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:48,020
>> And then the
acceleration

48
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,434
is the derivative
of the velocity.

49
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:52,400
>> So again,
simple derivatives

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,630
taken in each component.

51
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,060
The acceleration
is the rate at

52
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,415
which the velocity
is changing.

53
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,870
It helps to understand

54
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,295
acceleration by looking at

55
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:07,489
a plot of the
acceleration vector.

56
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,105
>> So as T stands for time

57
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:15,545
moves from t equals
to 0 and increases,

58
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:16,820
we can see what happens to

59
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,670
the position
vector in blue,

60
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,055
the velocity vector in red,

61
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:25,249
and then the acceleration
vector in green.

62
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,870
>> Immediately, we
can already see

63
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,610
the acceleration vector is

64
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,830
pointing back away
from the circle.

65
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,360
So maybe it's
not surprising

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,580
that the acceleration
as you traverse

67
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,290
around a circle is

68
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,660
always constant
inwards towards

69
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,500
the middle to determine

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,240
the point at which the
released the ball.

71
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,220
So they hits a tree.

72
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,570
That was question number

73
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,429
three in the
original problem.

74
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,840
>> The tree stands

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,339
ten feet in front
of the boy.

76
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,110
>> Value of t
should the boy

77
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,920
released the string so

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,820
the ball hits the tree.

79
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,185
>> We can model
the situation

80
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,540
with a circle with the ball

81
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,400
spinning around
and then putting

82
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,864
a point at 0 comma ten
dedicate the tree.

83
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,710
>> So mathematically, what

84
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,670
we're really trying to do

85
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,055
is find the tangent line.

86
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,270
Whereas the ball is at

87
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,740
any point around
the circle,

88
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,690
the tangent line that goes

89
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,880
through the 0 comma ten.

90
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,380
So we can write
the equation of

91
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,000
the tangent line where

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,070
t naught is the time that

93
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,069
we will release the ball.

94
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,560
>> And that gives us
these two equations.

95
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,200
These two equations give us

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,755
parametric equations
where we know that

97
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,795
if indeed the point

98
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:56,380
is 0 comma ten
is on the line,

99
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,350
then this will equal 0.

100
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,180
>> At some point,
the x value equals

101
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,120
0 and the y value
equal, equal ten.

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,980
No, I don't show
the details here,

103
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,855
but you can solve

104
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:10,630
both of these equations
simultaneously.

105
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,210
One way to do it here
is to solve for t.

106
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,400
>> In the top equation
software t and

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,350
the bottom equation set

108
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,435
those two equations
equal to each other,

109
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,340
and that eliminates
the variable t.

110
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,785
>> And then you just
solve for t sub 0,

111
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,555
which is a trig equation.

112
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,710
And when you do that,
you get sine inverse

113
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,944
of 1 fifth, which is 0.2.

114
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:31,745
>> And after graphing it,

115
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:32,855
we can see that
that's correct,

116
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:37,790
that when you put
0.2 into T sub 0,

117
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,520
that gives us
exactly the tangent

118
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,054
line that goes
through the point.

119
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,350
>> So that is the angle for

120
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,775
which the ball
should be released

121
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,810
to hitters hit the tree.

122
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,830
Vector-valued functions

123
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,700
allow us to talk about

124
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,965
project to
projectile motion.

125
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:56,555
And when we're on planet,

126
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,310
like a planet
Earth, for example,

127
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,140
you have a
gravitational constant,

128
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,184
which is a force
being pushed down.

129
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:05,750
>> And we can use the
gravitational constant

130
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,420
here to give the X and Y

131
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,750
coordinates of
position given

132
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,620
an initial speed and
an angle of elevation.

133
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,940
>> We also have
nice formulas

134
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,050
for the distance traveled.

135
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,250
>> We can talk about

136
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,200
the total distance traveled

137
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,150
by integrating the
velocity vector,

138
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,160
the magnitude of the
velocity vector.

139
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
Notice that's the
total distance

140
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,359
traveled over
that interval.

141
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,040
>> And we don't really know

142
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,570
the direction where we're

143
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,324
integrating the speed,

144
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:42,080
the magnitude of the
velocity vector.

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,840
>> Here we can find

146
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,170
the average speed by
taking the speed over

147
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,520
the interval and then

148
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,540
divided by the length of

149
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,970
the interval and

150
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,880
then the average velocity
in the same way.

151
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,355
Note that the average speed

152
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:00,919
doesn't give us
a direction.

153
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,735
>> And the average
speed here

154
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:05,225
is actually going to
be just a number.

155
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,650
The average velocity is

156
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,520
going to give us a vector.
