1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Hi, class.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,950
>> Let's take a look at

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,780
a quick overview
of section 12.1.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,240
Now we're going to be
looking at functions of

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,390
two real variables before.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,440
And calculus,
we've been looking

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,195
functions of a single
real variable.

8
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,580
Now our inputs to
our functions are

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,220
going to be
points x comma y.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,390
Or in the case
of a function of

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,420
three variables points
x comma, y comma z.

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,570
We can graph a function
of two variables with

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,624
a single output like this.

14
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,720
>> Every input is

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,094
some x comma y in
the x, y plane.

16
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:37,190
>> We put that point

17
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,210
into the function
that gives

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,460
us a z value as an output.

19
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,430
So that describes
a surface.

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,020
If we have a nice
continuous function like

21
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,850
this in
three-dimensional space,

22
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,160
you can be asked a lot
of the same types of

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,690
questions that we
had in calculus.

24
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,060
One, about finding
domains and

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,895
ranges of functions of
two or more variables.

26
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,770
In this case, let's
find the domain of

27
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,829
a function given here.

28
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,020
>> To find the
domain, remember it's

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,300
all points x comma y where

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,959
the functions has
a valid output.

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,620
>> So we can't

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,375
take the square
root of a negative,

33
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,710
but we can take
the square root

34
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,780
of any non-negative number.

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,580
So that is the constraint

36
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,394
that we're going to
use to find this.

37
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:24,760
>> First we can
find the function's

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,559
value at 0 comma 0.

39
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:28,900
>> That's just
sticking 0 comma

40
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,570
0 into the function
x is 0, y is 0.

41
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,859
Solve, we get one.

42
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,120
>> So a point on

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,040
the graph of this function

44
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,420
is 0 comma 0 comma one.

45
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,480
>> Good.

46
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,535
>> Now the domain
is determined

47
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,960
by the collection of

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,729
points where the
function is defined.

49
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,780
>> And this function is

50
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,010
defined as long as the part

51
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,060
underneath the square root

52
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,770
is greater than
or equal to 0.

53
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,610
So that gives us

54
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,410
the following
inequality here.

55
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,940
We could shuffle
things around

56
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,110
a bit and notice that

57
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,780
our inequality
is very similar

58
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,275
to the standard
form of an ellipse.

59
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,120
In fact, if this
was x squared over

60
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,490
nine plus y squared over
four equals to one.

61
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,685
It would just be an
ellipse in standard form.

62
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:12,260
But the less
than or equal to

63
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,640
one means that the x

64
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,339
and y values are
allowed to be smaller.

65
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,690
>> So it's actually
describing

66
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,280
the interior of an ellipse.

67
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,630
>> So the set of
points where x squared

68
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,220
over nine plus y
squared over four

69
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,450
is less than or
equal to one is

70
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,504
the inside of this ellipse.

71
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:29,960
>> So that's going
to be the domain of

72
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,814
the function for the range.

73
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:34,625
>> We want to look at

74
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,875
all possible
z-values achieved

75
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,444
by putting in those x
values in the domain.

76
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:41,900
>> And for that it's

77
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,579
maybe a little bit
trickier to see.

78
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,550
>> But if we put
the 0 comma 0,

79
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,589
in which we did,
we got one.

80
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:49,820
>> And that's actually the

81
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,199
biggest that
we'll ever get.

82
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,490
>> Because you can

83
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,900
see underneath
the function f,

84
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,190
we have 12x minus

85
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,769
positive number.
Positive number.

86
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,115
>> So any value of x
and y that's not 0,

87
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,060
you're gonna be subtracting

88
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,569
a positive quantity here.

89
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,305
>> And which is gonna
be less than one.

90
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,240
So one's the biggest
that we can get

91
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,760
and 0 is the
smallest we can get.

92
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,750
So that gives us a range of

93
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,225
all of the numbers
from 0 to one.

94
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,040
We can graph the function.

95
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,545
And a 3D graphing utility

96
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:21,970
that's just kind of

97
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,590
satisfying to be
able to do to,

98
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,050
to see that all of our
analysis is working.

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,375
Oftentimes we want to look

100
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,520
at our three-dimensional
surfaces or

101
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,110
graphs of are functions of

102
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,670
two variables by looking at

103
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,514
are what are called
level curves.

104
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:40,750
>> And these are the
cross sections for

105
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,144
various constant
slices of z.

106
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:46,700
>> So the idea of

107
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,350
a level curve or

108
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,210
a contour map is
actually quite

109
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,380
familiar to anyone who's

110
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,720
looked at a map

111
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,534
for hiking, like
a mountain map.

112
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,680
>> So you have a map
that looks like this,

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,810
and we have these,
these lines in it.

114
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,030
>> And the lines
correspond to

115
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,730
places where the altitude
is not changing.

116
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,980
So if you were to walk
along these lines,

117
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,665
you will have the
same z value.

118
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:12,755
And when the lines are
very close together,

119
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,170
that means that if
you were to walk

120
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,329
perpendicular to the
lines are orthogonal,

121
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,619
it will be very steep.

122
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,990
>> If the lines
are far apart,

123
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,790
that means you
will be walking

124
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,260
a great distance in

125
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,200
order to achieve
that same level

126
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,930
of altitude that
you would be

127
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,770
over here if you were to

128
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,670
walk a short distance

129
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,050
to gain that level
of altitude,

130
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,670
which means it's
relatively flat,

131
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,185
relatively flat down here,

132
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,479
relatively steep over here.

133
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,199
>> So the way we talk
about kind of analyze

134
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,960
three-dimensional surfaces
is very much like

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,700
how we look at Level curves

136
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,515
and topographical map.

137
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,780
So we can take a look
at the same function

138
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,854
again and look at
its level curves.

139
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:57,380
>> That means taking
various zi values,

140
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,780
and we'll call them C at

141
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,690
a constant level,
constant steps.

142
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,240
So in our case,
our RZ steps

143
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,690
are at length of 0.2 each.

144
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,740
>> And we just
set our output

145
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,380
equal to those values.

146
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,580
And that gives us all

147
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,320
of these different curves

148
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,550
in the XY plane.

149
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,140
But remember the curve,
curves in the x,

150
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,000
y plane correspond to

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,110
the cross-sections

152
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,520
at these different
z values.

153
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,090
>> We can shuffle things
around a little bit

154
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,410
and see that
these are really

155
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,850
just ellipses

156
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,140
and they are
concentric ellipses.

157
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,670
>> If we graph
each of these,

158
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,410
what we see is
what's called a

159
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,779
contour plot of
the function.

160
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,820
>> And this is
a visualization

161
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,770
of that three-dimensional
graph, right, as F,

162
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,985
as we sliced cross-sections

163
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,150
with planes parallel
to the xy axis,

164
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,265
we can see towards the edge

165
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:00,200
that the graph is
rather steep in

166
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,300
the z direction
and then toward

167
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,650
the middle graph is

168
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,150
rather flat in
the z direction.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,245
Can also discuss functions

170
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,835
of three variables.

171
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,410
We can, of course graph

172
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,610
a function of
three variables.

173
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,139
>> We need four
dimensions for that.

174
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,990
>> But if we look at
its level curves,

175
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,950
we can set the
function z values to

176
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,130
certain constant values and

177
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,480
then graph those surfaces

178
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,520
in three-dimensional space.

179
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,620
So here we're
looking at the level

180
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,820
curves of this function.

181
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,840
X squared over nine plus

182
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
y squared over four plus x

183
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,635
squared over
four equals to,

184
