1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Here in Section 14.4,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,270
we're going to take a
look at flow, flux,

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,560
Green's theorem
and the Divergence

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,815
Theorem. First, flow.

5
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:10,765
When the vector
fields interpreted

6
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:12,790
as velocity vectors.

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,440
Then the line integral over

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,495
a curve represents flow.

9
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:19,240
We've already looked
at line integrals in

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,860
a vector field that

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,235
we interpreted as
work previously.

12
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:26,470
If the vector field was a,

13
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,270
a bunch of forces.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,070
Now we're thinking
of the vector field

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,600
as velocity vectors,

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,670
maybe describing how
things are moving.

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,260
So therefore, the
line integral now

18
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,855
represents the flow
over that curve.

19
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,285
Here we have a picture
of a vector field,

20
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:43,640
capital F and three curves.

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,530
If we look at the
flow of curve one,

22
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,610
we see that the flow of the

23
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,080
vector field is going

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,620
in the same direction
as the curve c1.

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,540
So therefore the flow is

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,030
going to be
positive over c1.

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,440
We're also going to learn

28
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,970
a notion called flux.

29
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,720
Flux is the measure of

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,580
the vector field crossing

31
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,940
the curve tangentially
or orthogonally.

32
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,680
We can see since
the flow is going

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,470
direly in the direction
of the curve c1,

34
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,350
the flux would
be 0 over C1.

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,940
The flow across C2
will be 0 because

36
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,310
the vector field
not contributing

37
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,295
any movement to movement
along the curve, C2.

38
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,570
But the flux would

39
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,640
be positive
because movement

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,285
across the curve is
entirely happening here.

41
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,690
And then in S3 is
a little bit of

42
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,200
both is happening fluxes,

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,700
the summation of the amount

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,010
of vector field
tangent to the curve.

45
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,859
So flow is the accumulation

46
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,000
of things going in

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,050
the direction of the curve,

48
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,970
flux or the things
crossing the curve.

49
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,290
We can define this
mathematically

50
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,390
with the two
integrals, right?

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,350
The flow is the movement

52
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,910
in the direction
of the curve

53
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,470
with a unit tangent vector.

54
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,000
The flux is the movement

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,155
tangent to the curve.

56
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:12,020
So use the normal
vector n. Now,

57
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,455
flux could be measured
in a couple of

58
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:15,410
different ways depending on

59
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,360
what you mean by

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,115
left to right or
right to left,

61
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:22,010
you can cross a curve
in two different ways.

62
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,785
So we have to define

63
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,690
what we mean by positive.

64
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,580
And we're talking
about a unit normal.

65
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,020
The unit normal
vector could be

66
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,310
like pointing to the
right of the curve,

67
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,765
but it could be
pointing to the left.

68
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,070
So defined this in general,

69
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,315
we have to be careful

70
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:37,595
about what is left,
what is right.

71
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,170
And in general,
the convention is

72
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,630
that if you have
a closed curve,

73
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,940
so like a loop that
comes back to itself,

74
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,730
the unit normal vector
points to the outside.

75
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,200
So remember that
the definition of

76
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,435
the unit tangent vector,

77
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,580
if we have a
parametrization of

78
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,160
our curve R is
given here as

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,605
capital T. Then
if we want to

80
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:06,875
rotate that 90
degrees to the right,

81
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,780
we're going to define

82
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,610
the outside of the curve is

83
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,560
always being to the right

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,794
as we traverse clockwise.

85
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,125
So by flipping
the components

86
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,330
of the x and y here
and negating it,

87
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,460
we have created a vector
that's orthogonal to

88
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,675
the unit tangent vector

89
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,340
and 90 degrees
to the right.

90
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,380
So that's what we'll
use as our unit normal

91
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,360
vector to define flux.

92
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,040
So flux is the integral of

93
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,690
the vector field dotted

94
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,145
with the normal vector.

95
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:39,200
And when we
substitute all values

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,104
in here and simplify,

97
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,650
we see that we start to get

98
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,075
a nice simple expression

99
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,085
for finding flux.

100
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,500
Now remember, m and n are

101
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,125
the component functions
of the vector field,

102
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,090
and f and g are

103
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,170
the components of the

104
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,340
parametrization
of the curve

105
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,230
C. Oftentimes we see

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,310
the flux written as

107
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,215
these bottom two integrals

108
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:05,435
because it's a
nice compact form.

109
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:07,970
But remember it
really is this line

110
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,490
integral dotted with
the unit normal vector.

111
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,950
So here we have
an example with

112
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,380
two curves, C1 and C2.

113
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,260
In a vector
field. We want to

114
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,745
find the flow in the flux

115
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,905
across the c1 and c2.

116
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:27,485
First, we parameterize c1.

117
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:30,800
We parameterize C1
starting when t is 0,

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,390
starts here at one comma 0.

119
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,580
And as t goes to one,

120
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,070
we end up at the
0 comma one.

121
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,910
So R, R1 parameterizes
the curve c1 in here.

122
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,180
C2 is actually a portion
of the unit circle.

123
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,120
So there we can
parameterize with cosine t,

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,580
sine t, as t goes from
0 to pi over two.

125
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,765
For the flow across C1,

126
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:54,890
we calculate the line

127
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,450
integral over the
vector field.

128
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,160
We put our parametrization

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,990
into the vector
field function,

130
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,940
and then we find
the derivative of

131
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,760
our parametrization.

132
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,055
You see here is
negative 11.

133
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:08,810
You take the dot
product and we get

134
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,100
a simple integral in our,

135
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,380
in our flow across
C1 is just one.

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,240
The flux across C1

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,530
is the'd dot product
with the normal vector.

138
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,210
Again, we use
the formula we

139
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,830
developed in the
previous slide,

140
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,900
where we have m times

141
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,700
the derivative of
g minus n times

142
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,760
the derivative of f. And

143
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,440
since we have these

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,330
component functions
for capital,

145
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,910
for the vector field m

146
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,180
here is negative x
and n is 2y minus x.

147
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,080
And we put in

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,540
our parametrization
into those values.

149
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,610
See the parameterization is

150
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,260
one minus t for x.

151
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,430
So we put in one minus

152
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,900
t everywhere we see an x,

153
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,685
we put a t everywhere
we see a y.

154
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,170
And that's where we see

155
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,535
these values come from.

156
00:05:55,535 --> 00:06:00,840
But we see the flux
across C1 is actually 0.

157
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,400
And we can see in

158
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,810
the picture here
that makes sense

159
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,190
because we have things

160
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,950
crossing the
bottom part of C,

161
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,900
one from top to bottom,

162
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,520
but then they
are going back

163
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,335
across on the other side.

164
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:19,220
So the total accumulated
crossing here is 0.

165
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,645
Now we find the
flow for C2.

166
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:25,735
Again, we take our
parametrization,

167
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,400
we put it into

168
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,140
the vector field function

169
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,295
to find the derivative.

170
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,930
Take the dot product,
and then we have

171
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,700
a nice integral in here.

172
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,715
The flow is about 0.7.

173
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:40,030
And then finally,
the flux across C2.

174
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,520
Again, we put our
parametrization into

175
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,480
the vector field
function to get

176
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,375
function in terms
of t. And we

177
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,470
take the derivative of

178
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,750
the functions of our
parametrization,

179
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,040
make the
calculation, and we

180
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,800
get the flux being
about 0.285.

181
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,210
Green's theorem is

182
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,710
a very important fit
theorem that kind

183
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,990
of connects the work

184
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,510
integral with the curl

185
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,300
of the function
inside of the region.

186
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,725
So here's an example
of a vector field

187
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,030
over this region are

188
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,410
defined by a fairly

189
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,680
complicated
parameterized curve.

190
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,270
Now we're supposed to find

191
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,220
the circulation
around the curve

192
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,725
C. That would mean

193
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,440
parameterizing
this curve and,

194
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,180
and developing
the line integral

195
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,980
and integrating
these functions.

196
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,720
Instead, we can use greens,

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,870
Greens theorem to
find the curl of

198
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,370
the vector field
and then just

199
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,380
integrate that
over the region.

200
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,910
But it turns out
that the curl of

201
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,115
the vector field
is always 0.

202
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,540
So even though the region

203
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,225
inside of the curve is
somewhat complicated,

204
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,650
we can keep our integral

205
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,630
general and just
call that region R.

206
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,130
And we're just
going to integrate

207
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,050
the function 0 anyways,

208
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,390
so it's going to
be 0, so there is

209
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,180
no circulation
around the outside.

210
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,110
Another important
theorem is

211
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,105
the Debye
divergence theorem.

212
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:11,360
And this connects
the flux across

213
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
the boundary of
the region with

214
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,780
the divergence on the
inside of the region.

215
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,790
The benefit here
is that the line

216
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,980
integral can be somewhat

217
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,645
difficult integral to find.

218
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,160
So instead, maybe we

219
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,930
find the divergence
of the vector field,

220
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,310
which could be
quite simple,

221
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,370
and then find that
double integral instead.

222
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,410
So that's what's
happening here.

223
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,210
In this example, we
have a vector field

224
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,025
defined as capital F. Here,

225
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:40,115
curve is the circle
of radius two.

226
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:44,060
So we want to find the
flux across the curve.

227
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,100
Remember, that's,
that's the amount

228
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,280
of crossing
across the curve.

229
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,200
So we do this the hard way.

230
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,940
We would have to
actually parameterize

231
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,110
the curve and then

232
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,995
use the formula for
the, for the flux.

233
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,330
Instead, we can find

234
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,060
the divergence of
the vector field,

235
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,160
which we remember as
this formula here.

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,270
It's the derivative of the

237
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,830
first component
with respect to x

238
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,210
plus the second component

239
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,115
respect to y is just two.

240
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,530
So all we need to do
is find the double

241
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,850
integral over the inside of

242
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,680
the region of the
Function two.

243
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,570
And we get that I
simply eight pi
