1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Let's take a look at

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,850
the divergence theorem for

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,200
higher dimensions
and Stokes theorem

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,735
in our final section 14.7,

5
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:09,960
we previously did
previously studied

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,715
the divergence theorem over

7
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:14,055
a two-dimensional region.

8
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,170
So we were able
to calculate

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,620
the total flux
across a boundary,

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,615
call a closed curve c,

11
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:25,515
by integrating the
divergence on the inside.

12
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,260
Now we have a
surface and we want

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,800
to calculate

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,750
the total flux
through the surface.

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,045
Again, we'll do
that by integrating

16
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,650
the three-dimensional
region of

17
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,090
the divergence
of the inside.

18
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,680
Let's take a look
at an example.

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,795
Here we have a region D

20
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,910
and is bounded by
plane z equal to 0,

21
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,410
is equal to 2x,
the cylinder

22
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,330
x equal one
minus y squared.

23
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,890
And we have a vector field

24
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,540
f that surrounds it.

25
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,090
We could find the
total flux across

26
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,370
the surfaces by
parameterizing

27
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,380
each surface and then

28
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,380
calculating those
surface integrals with

29
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,050
the normal vector
and C accumulate

30
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,870
the total amount that's

31
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,430
gone through the surface.

32
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,340
Instead, we can setup

33
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,390
with the spine the

34
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,995
divergence of the
vector field,

35
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,424
which is a relatively
easy calculation.

36
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:16,910
And then integrate that

37
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,264
divergence function
on the inside,

38
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:20,930
which is a relatively

39
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,670
straightforward
triple integral.

40
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,830
So we see that
the total flux

41
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,635
across the surface
here is 16 over five.

42
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:32,480
And we didn't have to do

43
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,710
any parameterizations of

44
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,790
the service Stokes theorem

45
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,670
is a generalization
of Green's theorem.

46
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,865
Now we have a
surface S and we

47
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:46,970
can find the line

48
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,730
integral by adding up

49
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,440
the curl on the inside

50
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,000
of the surface with
the service integral.

51
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,405
So here we have

52
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:59,150
a function that describes

53
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,775
a plane seven
minus 2x minus 2y,

54
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:06,470
and then a curve that
sits on that plane,

55
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,630
which is a circle
of radius one.

56
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,300
What we can do is
first parameterize

57
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,645
the curve C. Well,

58
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:18,890
first we'll parameterize

59
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,435
actually the unit disk,

60
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:23,090
which is cosine U, sine U,

61
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,165
by adding one to

62
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:27,830
the x component
and y component,

63
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,060
that shifts the circle

64
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,145
here to the first quadrant.

65
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:34,295
And then we want to
describe the whole disk.

66
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,395
And so by
multiplying times V,

67
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:38,795
V plays the role of the
radius of the disc.

68
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,160
So it's a shift of

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,735
a polar coordinate
description

70
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:42,830
of the unit disk.

71
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,110
Now the first
two coordinates

72
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,445
here of our
parameterization,

73
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,455
or the X value
and the y value

74
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:49,760
of this unit disc

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,275
sitting in the
first quadrant.

76
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,200
Now we use that x value
and that y value,

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,090
put them into
the function to

78
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,535
find the corresponding
z value.

79
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,110
So that's where the,

80
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,525
that's how this
parameterization was found.

81
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,000
You use parameter
goes between

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,705
02 pi and these primary
goes between 01.

83
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,580
We can calculate the curl

84
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,260
of the vector field
that we're given,

85
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,670
which is just these partial

86
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,310
derivatives taken
the differences.

87
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,470
And that allows us to

88
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,230
calculate the
surface integral.

89
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,850
So the surface integral

90
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,175
is the integral
of the curl,

91
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,825
which we found previously,

92
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:29,315
dot product with
the cross product

93
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:30,950
of the partial derivatives

94
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,050
of our parameterization.

95
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,730
And this is a fairly

96
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,690
straightforward integral.

97
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,385
And we get that the,

98
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:41,670
the total is three pi
