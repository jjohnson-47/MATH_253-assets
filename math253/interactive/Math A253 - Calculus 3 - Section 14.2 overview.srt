1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's take a look at
vector fields in section

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,310
14 to a vector field
is a function.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,270
And for every point in
a set in the plane,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,830
R2 are in
three-dimensional space.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,130
R3 is associated
with a vector,

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,440
usually a capital F
or a capital letter

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,240
is what we use to denote

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,655
the vector field function.

9
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,110
And the components of

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,340
the vector field function

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,470
are usually used with
the letters capital M,

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,605
capital N. But

13
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:34,760
the important
thing to remember

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,440
is that a vector field sort

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,540
of as a collection
of vectors,

16
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,265
but it's a collection
of vectors

17
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,810
that every point in

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,980
the domain is

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,780
associated with
a single vector.

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,790
Here's a picture of
a few vector fields.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,440
The first one
here is a vector

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,670
field on the square

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,865
from negative one to
one in the plane.

24
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,380
The second one is a

25
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,510
vector field over
the whole plane.

26
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,165
And then the third is a
vector plane over all

27
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:05,700
of R3 in
three-dimensional space.

28
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,720
Each component of
a vector field is

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,630
a scalar or a real
valued function.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,960
Oftentimes when
we're talking about

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,460
the vector field
as a whole,

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,260
we kinda drop the x

33
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,790
and y are the X, Y, and Z.

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,625
And we just write
the letters of the,

35
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,950
of the component functions.

36
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,350
An important
object for talking

37
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,570
about things that
our vector field

38
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,310
is the del operator.

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,160
That's this upside
down triangle here.

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,455
If we have, we've
already seen this

41
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:45,050
in context of the gradient.

42
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,060
So if we have a function,

43
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,870
the gradient was this
del of f equals to

44
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,430
the vector of partial
derivatives of

45
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,190
f. So in fact,

46
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,320
if we have a function
that's differentiable,

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,020
then the gradient
itself defines

48
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,030
a vector field
for every point

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,715
x comma y in the domain
of the function,

50
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,025
there is a
corresponding vector,

51
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,995
the gradient, and that

52
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:12,725
those vectors correspond
to a vector field.

53
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,320
But let's just focus
on the operator,

54
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,255
the triangle
operator itself.

55
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,580
We like to think of
that as being a vector,

56
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,000
any vector of
derivative operators.

57
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,430
Since F, when we looked
at the gradient,

58
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,080
f is a scalar function.

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,690
When you write
the del operator

60
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,625
as this vector
of derivatives,

61
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,950
you just follow the
normal laws of vectors.

62
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,930
We bring the F into
each component,

63
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,805
apply the operator to f,

64
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:41,420
and that's how you

65
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,710
get the partial
derivatives.

66
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,910
So this is just a new way

67
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,215
of looking at the gradient,

68
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,120
but with a focus
on the action

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
of this operator itself.

70
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,740
One of the
important ideas n

71
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,900
a vector field
is divergence,

72
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,000
which is a measure of how

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
the movement in

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,530
the vector field is
either compressing,

75
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,420
things, are
expanding things.

76
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,230
This is really useful
in fluid situations,

77
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,900
gas or liquids,
that you want

78
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,340
to know whether
there is expansion

79
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,530
happening or compression.

80
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,110
To measure the divergence,

81
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,510
it's convenient to
use the del operator,

82
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,680
and it's actually
defined as

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
just the dot product

84
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,500
of the del operator
with the vector field.

85
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,085
Also with a vector field,

86
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,530
a really important
idea is the curl,

87
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,090
which measures the spinning

88
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,100
action of the vector field.

89
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,620
Oftentimes we want to
know how are things are

90
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,985
rotating inside
the vector field.

91
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,050
And the del operator

92
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,805
is also convenient
to find the curl.

93
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,485
It's actually the
cross product

94
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:48,910
with the vector field.

95
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,310
So this gives a
convenient way to

96
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,500
remember the formula for
divergence and curl.

97
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,835
Let's take a look
at an example.

98
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,890
So here's a graph of
the vector field and

99
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,100
let's discuss its
divergence and curl.

100
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,755
The divergence is
the dot product

101
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:08,170
of the del operator
with the vector field.

102
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,660
So we take the doc
product, we apply it,

103
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,265
and we see that it's 0.

104
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,300
And what does that mean?

105
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,860
That means that
any point x comma

106
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,450
y in R vector field,

107
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,670
picture here, there is

108
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,505
no compression or expansion

109
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:22,960
happening at that point.

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,035
Things are not building
up the curl though,

111
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,130
since the, we see

112
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,270
things that are
kind of spinning

113
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,730
around in perhaps
consorting at places.

114
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,800
The curl does change from

115
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,140
place to place based
on this function,

116
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,610
cosine x plus sine of y.

117
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,969
If the vector field itself

118
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,530
can be found by taking

119
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,074
the gradient of a function,

120
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,380
then that function
is called

121
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,925
a potential function.

122
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,400
And that function plays
an important role

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
in some nice properties

124
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,150
of that particular
vector field.

125
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,925
Vector fields that have
a potential function

126
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,780
are often called the

127
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,265
conservative vector fields.

128
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:04,030
And how many broken

129
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,320
important properties
in physics.
