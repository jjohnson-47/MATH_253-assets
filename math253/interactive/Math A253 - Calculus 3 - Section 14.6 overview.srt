1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Let's take a
look at surface

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,630
integrals in section 14.6.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,780
The motivation for surface

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,070
integrals is finding

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,300
the mass of a sheet of

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,340
material or say
sheet of metal.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,580
It all is based on

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,425
the really important
formula that the mass

9
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,880
is the amount of

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800
surface area times
the density.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,440
If we have a density
function which describes

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,455
the density at any point
along the surface.

13
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:27,915
And we can take
the mass to be the

14
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,030
integral of the
density function

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,930
over the surface,

16
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,820
where ds here represents

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,030
a very small area
along the surface.

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,580
So in general, to

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,950
find any kind of function,
surface integral,

20
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,050
we have some
function defined on

21
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,370
the surface and we

22
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,665
integrate that function
over the surface.

23
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:49,340
This has

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,575
many important
applications in physics.

25
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,050
If the function measures
the static charge,

26
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,310
we can accumulate

27
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,335
that static charge
across the sheet.

28
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:58,955
If it measures
the amount of

29
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:00,980
measures of fluid passing
through a screen,

30
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,690
we can accumulate all of

31
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,770
that fluid to
find the total

32
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,880
amount that's
moved through.

33
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,810
Here's an example
of a triangular

34
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,925
region above a plane,

35
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,230
above a given plane to x

36
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,105
plus y plus z equals three.

37
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:17,165
And we want, and we have
a density function.

38
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,040
And we want to find
the mass of this

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,355
particular, this
particular surface.

40
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:25,430
First, we need to
parameterize the surface.

41
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,455
And we can start
by parameterizing

42
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,320
the triangular region
below the surface.

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,630
So as you moves from 0 to

44
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,315
one and v moves
from 0 to one.

45
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,250
We can describe
any point in

46
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,950
this short triangular
region here with

47
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,290
a x-value view and

48
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,220
a y value of v times
two minus two y2.

49
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,320
And that makes
that assures that

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,970
any point u and v in

51
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,600
these intervals
describes a unique point

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,710
inside the small triangle.

53
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,030
Now we take that if
we take you far x

54
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,530
value and v times

55
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,270
two minus two y2
for our y value,

56
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,950
put that into the equation

57
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,780
for the plane sulfur z.

58
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,065
To get the z value
in terms of u and v,

59
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:12,125
We now have a
parameterization for

60
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,180
the triangular
region sitting

61
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,410
above in the plane.

62
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,580
We're going to
find the mass.

63
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,270
So we need to use the
partial derivatives.

64
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,770
So we take the
partial derivative

65
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,275
of r with respect
to u and v,

66
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,080
and we take the derivative
in each component,

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
and then we find
the cross product

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,325
of those two partial
derivatives.

69
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:36,960
And then the magnitude
of the cross-product,

70
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,970
the density, is given

71
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,365
as a function
of x, y, and z.

72
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,850
So we have to
find the density

73
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,485
in terms of u
and v as well.

74
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,405
So we put our value of,

75
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,950
we put our values for x,

76
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,810
y, and z in terms
of u and v,

77
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,055
found in the previous
slide here, x, y,

78
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,350
and z in terms
of U and V into

79
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,060
the density function
and simplified.

80
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,305
And we now have the density

81
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,120
described in terms
of the variables u

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,950
and v. And that allows us

83
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,230
to write the integral
for the mass.

84
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,790
So the mass is the

85
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,370
integral of the
density function over

86
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,930
U and V times

87
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,710
the magnitude of

88
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,465
the cross product
of the derivatives,

89
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:21,210
and we end up getting
about 12.6 x.

90
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,485
We also want to
measure flux

91
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:25,790
across the surface.

92
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,440
And for flux, we need

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,450
to have a normal
vector along

94
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,010
the surface that tells us

95
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,330
what direction it is

96
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,385
orthogonal to the surface.

97
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:36,470
The vector that we're
going to use for

98
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,450
the normal vector
is given here.

99
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,190
It's a unit normal vector.

100
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,325
And it's that familiar
cross product

101
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:44,915
of the partial derivatives

102
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,220
of our parametrization.

103
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,020
So let's take a look at

104
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,880
the same triangular region,

105
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,500
but now we have
a vector field

106
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,305
defined in three-dimensional
space around it.

107
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,000
And we want to
measure the flux

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,740
across S. Again,

109
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,210
imagine that this
triangular region

110
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,860
is a screen and

111
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,100
the flux is some
measure of fluid,

112
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,960
a fluid flowing through

113
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
it and they are
integral is actually

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,595
going to give us a measure

115
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:15,200
of the amount
of fluid that's

116
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,630
phone, that goes between.

117
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,670
So in the previous
example we found

118
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,315
the cross-product
of the two vectors.

119
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:25,790
So we have the vector field

120
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,550
when we put in are e, r,

121
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,830
u and v parameterizations

122
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,800
into the unto the f,

123
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,780
which is the vector field.

124
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,190
Now we have the
vector field

125
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,330
described in terms of u and

126
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,885
v. So what is our flux?

127
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,810
Or flux is the integral
over the surface of

128
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,850
the vector field
dot product

129
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,425
with that normal vector.

130
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:51,410
But since we already
found the normal vector,

131
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,530
we can use the theorem
that allows us to take

132
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,090
the dot product of

133
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,305
the vector field with
the normal vector,

134
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:03,020
which gives us an
integral from 0 to one.

135
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,375
This function of u and v,

136
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,399
which turns out
to be five-thirds
