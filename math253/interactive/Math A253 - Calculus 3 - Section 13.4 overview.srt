1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
Let's look at mass
and center of

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,720
mass and Section 13.4.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,980
Sometimes we want to

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,170
describe something
called a lamina,

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,470
which is a planar
region here as

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,250
R with a constant
thickness and finite area.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,125
We'll remember
from physics that

8
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,000
the mass of something

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,700
is its density
times its area.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,830
Now if we take a small
piece of area here,

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,455
multiply it times
its density,

12
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,855
we will get that
small piece of mass.

13
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,220
And as we do that for tiny

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,960
little pieces
of the region,

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,400
add them all up,
and that can

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,900
approximate our total mass.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,590
And then as we allow
those pieces to

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,135
get smaller and
smaller and smaller,

19
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:47,465
smaller, then we'll
defied the integral.

20
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:50,150
So to find the mass over

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,260
a planar region R with

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,670
the density function here.

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,365
Delta is our
density function

24
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:56,540
is just the double
integral of

25
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,790
the density function
over the region

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,630
R. So let's find

27
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,280
the mass of a square lamina

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,230
with variable density here.

29
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,910
Sometimes it's
convenient to

30
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,830
graph the lamina,

31
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,040
the planar region with
the density function.

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,450
And here we can

33
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,740
actually guess
what our answer

34
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,220
is going to be.

35
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,320
Because the density,

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,460
although it's different on

37
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,720
different parts
of the lamina,

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,070
we can see that
it's the same

39
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,675
as to the right
and to the left.

40
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:26,180
And it's going to be three

41
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,680
on average the route.

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,540
>> So the answer here
is going to be three,

43
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,219
and we can see that
just from the picture.

44
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,600
>> But we can
also set up the

45
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,860
integral of the density

46
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,405
function over the region.

47
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,030
And if we do that, so
we set up the double

48
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,295
integral over R of
the density function.

49
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:42,050
It's an iterated
integral first with

50
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,970
respect to x, then
with respect to y.

51
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,815
And we see that the
answer is indeed three,

52
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,900
and that is the
mass of the lamina.

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,160
You can also find
this center of mass.

54
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,360
So first of all,
look at centre of

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,400
mass of a discrete system.

56
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
And this is the
simplest kind

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,040
where we have masses

58
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,899
all a line and located
at various X values.

59
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:04,580
>> Notice the
notation here.

60
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,845
>> The center of
mass is x bar.

61
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,510
That's the same
as in statistics

62
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,769
where we use the average.

63
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,290
>> This is really just
the weighted average.

64
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,795
>> So now if we have
three masses here,

65
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:20,960
1021, located at
these x values,

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
we can find the center
of mass by looking at

67
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,225
the ratio of the product,

68
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,260
the sums of the products

69
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,250
of the masses with the x

70
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,470
coordinates all divided
by the total mass.

71
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:37,880
>> The top of the
expression here is

72
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,130
often what we call the
moment of the system.

73
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,270
>> And that's
helpful because

74
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,380
we're going to look at

75
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,289
masses located in
two dimensions.

76
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,690
We will have the
moment across about

77
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,345
the y-axis in a moment
about the x axis.

78
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:53,680
And that allows
us to define

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,530
the center of mass with,

80
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,850
with n masses

81
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,560
located in
two-dimensional space.

82
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,820
>> Note that here
the moment about

83
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,300
the y axis is just
summing up the,

84
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,404
the parts with the
x coordinates.

85
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:13,330
>> And the moment
about the x-axis is a

86
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,520
summing up the parts
with the y coordinates.

87
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,130
So this is a summary
of how we can

88
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,870
find the mass and
the center of

89
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,700
mass of an object in
two-dimensional space.

90
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,965
In this case, a
planar lamina.

91
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,780
The only difference
is now we

92
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,340
integrate instead of sum,

93
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,110
so it's find the center of

94
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,104
mass of a square lamina.

95
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:42,535
>> Similar as before,

96
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:43,795
except now we're try

97
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:44,920
before we found the mass.

98
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,420
>> Now let's find
the center of mass.

99
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,365
The mass we found
to be three.

100
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:53,380
The moment about
the x axis and

101
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,020
y axis are found with
the integrals here.

102
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,730
And so the center
of mass is

103
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,990
just the coordinates

104
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,640
of the following
expressions.
