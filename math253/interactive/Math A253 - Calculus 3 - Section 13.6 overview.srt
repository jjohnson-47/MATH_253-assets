1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's look at the
volume between

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,799
surfaces and triple
integration.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,845
>> This is section 13.6.

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,230
If we have two functions of

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,365
two variables
over a region R,

6
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,390
then we can find the volume

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,470
of the space between

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,150
them by just taking the

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,505
double integral of
their difference.

10
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:23,085
Essentially this is
just saying that the,

11
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,815
you take the
larger volume of f

12
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:28,920
between surface
and they XY axis,

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,900
subtract the volume from

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,430
the service of g to the x,

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,510
y axis, and then

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,740
you get the volume
in-between.

17
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:39,170
>> Here we have an
example where we

18
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,730
want to find the volume of

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,480
the region bounded
between two planes

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,750
and the coordinate axes

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,610
x equal to 0 and
y equal to 0.

22
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,590
>> First, we want to
figure out what is

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,850
the region of integration

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,124
that we're
integrating over.

25
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,430
>> So what is the area in

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,870
the XY plane for

27
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,074
which we want to
find the integral.

28
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:03,860
>> This involves
finding where

29
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,660
these two planes intersect.

30
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,280
So defined where
the two points

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,765
intersect, you set the,

32
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,310
their equations
that must be

33
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,860
true equal to each
other simplify.

34
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,140
And we see that the
line 2x plus y equal to

35
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,730
four defines that

36
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,470
region where
they intersect.

37
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,960
So therefore, our
region of integration

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,120
then is x being

39
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,580
bounded between
02 and y being

40
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,520
bounded between
04 minus 2x.

41
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,414
We can draw picture
of this region.

42
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:37,144
>> And here we'll
integrate DY DX.

43
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:39,050
>> So for any x, fixed x

44
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,240
between 02 will integrate

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,560
y from 0 to the
function four minus 2x.

46
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,920
>> That allows us
to write the double

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,230
integral has an
iterated integral.

48
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,820
And then we evaluate that

49
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,085
integrated integral,
integral normally.

50
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:56,929
And we see that
the answer is 16.

51
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:59,510
>> So 16 R is the number of

52
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,970
cubic units bounded between

53
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,950
these two planes in
this particular region.

54
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,655
>> We can also view
the same example,

55
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:14,239
the same volume as a
triple, triple integral.

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,580
>> So a triple
integral is the

57
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,625
integral over a region,
planar region R,

58
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,620
but over a
three-dimensional region,

59
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,020
which we'll call d. And the

60
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,160
triple integral can be

61
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,900
written as an
iterated integral.

62
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,080
>> In this case,
where the last

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,950
integral is just
the same expression

64
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,450
that we had before,

65
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,529
where we were looking
at the, the distance,

66
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,150
the vertical distance,
you might say

67
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,520
the z distance between

68
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,844
the top plane and
the bottom plane.

69
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:47,600
>> So instead of
just subtracting

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,934
those two functions,

71
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,600
we see that's
just a result of

72
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,325
the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

73
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:53,690
If we integrate with those

74
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,009
as the limit of
integration,

75
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,420
limits of integration d z.

76
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,230
>> We can find a
triple integrals by

77
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,419
Looking at the
iterated integrals.

78
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,590
>> If our region happens to

79
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,299
be bounded by functions,

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,790
the definition of the

81
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,230
triple integral and how it

82
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,240
works comes down to

83
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,190
the same process as

84
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,450
defining the
double integral,

85
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,025
where there were looking at

86
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,350
smaller and
smaller rectangles

87
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,670
in the region
of integration.

88
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,690
And here we're looking at

89
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,219
smaller and smaller cubes

90
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,990
and the region
of integration.

91
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,820
Then we take the limit as

92
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,840
those cubes get smaller

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,650
and smaller and smaller.

94
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,160
>> And that's how we

95
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,420
define the triple integral.

96
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,480
>> Now here's a
region bounded by

97
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,700
a plane and the,

98
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,529
and the coordinate axes.

99
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,079
>> So we want to
determine this volume.

100
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,820
And because now that

101
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,680
we're looking at triple
integrals with a DX,

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
DY, DZ, there's actually

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,639
six different ways
we can do it.

104
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,575
>> D z, d y, dx,

105
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,870
dy dx, dy Weiss, and so on.

106
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,545
So the thing is, is
each choice on how you

107
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:04,820
decide to write the

108
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,309
integral should give
us the correct answer.

109
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,800
>> But it may differ
in terms of how the

110
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,570
integral gets
calculated because

111
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,140
of the limits of

112
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,849
integration might
be different.

113
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,640
>> So let's first look
at the case where

114
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,284
we integrated with
respect to z first.

115
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,220
>> That means
that we're going

116
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,405
to first look at

117
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:28,025
the portion of our
region in the xy axis.

118
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,510
And we can see here that's

119
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,770
bounded by the
line y equals

120
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,294
2x minus six minus 2x.

121
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,770
And we can get
that by letting z

122
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,880
equals to 0 in

123
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,529
the equation of
the plane here.

124
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,180
>> And so that's our region

125
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,550
R that we would normally
integrate over.

126
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,755
But now we want
to integrate z,

127
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:49,445
right when z is 0 to
the top of this region,

128
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:50,060
but the top of

129
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,350
the regions bounded
by the plane.

130
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,150
So we're going
to integrate DZ

131
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,099
from 0 to the plane.

132
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:58,055
>> And then we'll
integrate y

133
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:04,684
from 0 to six minus 2x.

134
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,245
>> Since that's
the function of X,

135
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,629
that's the boundary
of the region.

136
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,415
>> And then we'll
integrate x

137
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:13,620
finally from 0 to three.

138
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,370
>> Now if we change,

139
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,230
we leave DZ to be first.

140
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,340
So we're still
integrating from

141
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,020
the bottom here
and on the x,

142
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,809
y axis to the top
of the plane.

143
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,010
>> But now we're going to

144
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,630
change the
direction in which

145
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,680
we integrate with
respect to x and then y.

146
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,530
So notice that
if we this line

147
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,970
here that denotes

148
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,725
the boundary of
the bottom region,

149
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,420
if we were to
solve for x would

150
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,520
be three minus 1.5 y.

151
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,335
So there we would integrate

152
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:45,980
x from 0 to three
minus 1.5 Y.

153
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,775
And then finally integrate
y from 0 to six,

154
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:53,040
which shows in these
limits of integration.

155
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,990
>> Now let's integrate
with respect

156
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,324
to x first.

157
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,050
>> So then the base of our

158
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,824
integral is now
in the YZ axis.

159
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:05,660
>> So we're going
to integrate from x

160
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,764
equals to 0 to the plane.

161
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:10,730
>> But the plane, if
you were to solve for x

162
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,899
here is three minus
1.5 y minus three z.

163
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:18,360
>> Then we integrate
with respect to y.

164
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,860
>> If we solve for y here,

165
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,825
we get six minus three. Z

166
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,100
Which gives us this
boundary. And finally,

167
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,330
x from 0 to two,

168
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,670
I'm sorry, z from 0 to two.

169
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,110
And again, we can
switch the DZ, DY.

170
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,870
And all that's different
is we will now write

171
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,210
this boundary of the region

172
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,744
as two minus 1 third Y.

173
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,440
>> And now we
finally integrate

174
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,110
x, I'm sorry, and
to integrate,

175
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,910
integrate y from
0 to six K.

176
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,200
>> And then
finally we look at

177
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,790
the reading the integrals

178
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,154
with respect to y first.

179
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,345
>> So now we have the
base and the z-axis.

180
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:01,345
We integrate y
from its base,

181
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,460
from 0 to the plane.

182
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,230
And if you solve
for y here,

183
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,150
you get six minus
2x minus three z.

184
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,950
Then we integrate
with respect to z.

185
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,300
And we can see that

186
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,740
this gives us
the boundary of

187
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,385
two minus two
thirds x and then,

188
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,410
and then finally x
from 0 to three.

189
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,905
And then similarly,
if we change

190
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:25,915
the dx and DZ again,

191
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:28,360
and I'll throw in all
six of these integrals.

192
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,130
The answer is 66 is

193
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,690
what we get for the volume.

194
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,940
Now, which one should
we choose if all

195
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,570
through all six of

196
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,130
these integrals give
us the same answer.

197
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,320
Six, the answer
typically is the

198
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,825
one with the easiest
calculations to do.

199
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,400
And in this case,

200
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,270
it kinda comes down to

201
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,580
maybe less fractions here.

202
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,370
And number 56, we
get somewhat of

203
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,640
a nicer expression to
work with immediately.

204
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,714
>> Here's another example.

205
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,200
>> We want to find
the volume of

206
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,135
the region d shown here,

207
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:00,980
which is bounded above by

208
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,425
the plane z equals
to minus y,

209
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:06,380
and bounded below by the x,

210
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,120
y axis and the

211
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,440
cylinder x squared plus

212
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,550
y squared equal to one.

213
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,180
So if we set up the triple

214
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,100
integral with respect to

215
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,885
z first than the base

216
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:19,580
is going to be in
the x, y axis.

217
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,640
And we see the base here
as the hemisphere in

218
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,820
the negative y hemisphere

219
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,870
of a circle of radius

220
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,194
one and the negative
y direction.

221
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:31,535
>> So that's going to
set up an interval,

222
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:33,515
an integral with,

223
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,905
with respect to
d z d by dx.

224
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,485
So we can set up
the integral.

225
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,810
And we're first
gonna integrate d

226
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,689
z from 0 to negative Y.

227
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:45,574
>> Again.

228
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,315
>> Again, if we take
an arbitrary point

229
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:48,890
here and then we

230
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,364
integrate from z equals
to 0 to the top.

231
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,169
>> The top is bounded
by this plane.

232
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,700
>> So that's
where we get the

233
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,094
0 to negative y.

234
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,480
>> And then d y is gonna go

235
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,574
from negative root one
minus x squared to 0.

236
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:07,520
>> Well, that's
going to be here

237
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,274
on the edge of the circle.

238
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,120
>> X squared plus y
squared equal to one.

239
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,470
If you were to solve for,

240
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,270
solve for y, and

241
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,620
then we were on
the negative Y.

242
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,060
So we want the negative
square root of

243
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,880
one minus x squared
all the way to 0.

244
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,935
So that sets up the
second integral.

245
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,420
Then finally, X
is going to be

246
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,070
integrating from
negative one to one.

247
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,045
Now this is just an

248
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:27,140
iterated integral where we

249
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,050
integrate the inside
from the inside out.

250
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,210
So here the answer
is two-thirds.

251
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,770
>> An important property

252
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,060
of triple integral
integrals,

253
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,470
similar to double
integrals,

254
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,920
is that we might be
trying to do triple,

255
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,185
triple integral over
a spacial region.

256
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,955
That's quite complicated,

257
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,470
or it's just
not possible to

258
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,270
write a simple iterated

259
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,910
integral over that region,

260
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,770
maybe because
the boundaries

261
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,869
aren't described by
a single function.

262
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:58,040
>> Well, what we
can do is take

263
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,540
that region and

264
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,130
divide it cleverly into

265
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,140
pieces that can be
written easily.

266
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,000
And then we can
find the overall

267
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,010
integral as the sum
of the easier pieces.

268
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,280
>> We can write triple
integrals bounded

269
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,919
by functions with the
following formula.

270
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,765
>> This is just the,

271
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,310
the general case of what we

272
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,809
saw in our
examples earlier.

273
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,460
>> And then the definition

274
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,110
of the triple integral of

275
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,145
a function is
similarly defined.

276
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:31,490
It's the limit of these
small little pieces,

277
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,170
a volume times the function

278
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,680
and add it all

279
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,119
up to approximate
the integral.

280
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,350
>> But then we
take the limit as

281
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,750
those small pieces
of volume go to 0.

282
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,739
So an immediate application

283
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:45,940
that we see with a triple

284
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,860
integral over

285
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,630
of a function of
three variables.

286
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,465
>> Here is thinking about

287
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:56,274
the function being
the density function.

288
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,515
>> Because if we have
a spatial region D,

289
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,480
and we have a density

290
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,370
function on that region.

291
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,710
And then integrating
that with

292
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,775
respect to the area

293
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,920
is going to give
us the mass.

294
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,455
Once we have a way
to find the mass,

295
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,730
then we can find the center

296
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,739
of mass of the region.

297
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,824
>> And indeed That's
what we have here.

298
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:18,560
>> We can find

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,270
that mass over a
bounded region of

300
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,995
space with a
density function

301
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,435
with the triple integral,

302
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:25,550
we can find the moments

303
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,110
with respect to the YZ,

304
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,075
X Z and X, Y plane.

305
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,190
Remember, these
moments are just,

306
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,130
they're sort of
numerators of

307
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,325
the weighted average right,

308
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:38,330
in each direction.

309
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,350
And correspondingly, this

310
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,790
one in the x direction,

311
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,080
this one in the
y direction,

312
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,370
this one in the
z direction.

313
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,840
So that, and then
we divide by

314
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,460
the overall mass and we

315
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,320
get the center of
mass of the object.
